how to train a puppy,Crates Rank High as a Potty Training Tool,"Many people who are new to dogs cringe at the idea of confining their puppies in a crate, but the reluctance to use this tool generally evaporates after a few days of living with a new pet. Dog crates make life easier. It’s a good idea to get your dog accustomed to one for many reasons, such as vet visits, travel, convalescence, and safety.

Dogs are den animals and will seek out a little canine cave for security whether you provide one or not. That makes it relatively easy to train your dog to love her crate.

The principle behind using a crate for housetraining is that dogs are very clean creatures and don’t like a urine-soaked rug in their living spaces any more than you do. It’s important that the crate is the right size—just large enough for the dog to lie down, stand up, and turn around. If it is too large, the dog will feel that it’s OK to use one corner for elimination and then happily settle down away from the mess. Many crates come with partitions so you can adjust the size as your puppy grows.

When she feels an urge, the puppy will usually let you know by whining and scratching. That’s her signal that she has to go and wants out of her little den. Now! Don’t delay because if you let your pup lose control in her crate, she’ll get the idea that it’s OK to mess up her living space. Then she’ll think nothing of leaving little packages around where you live, too.",Puppy Pads and Paper Training,"Dr. Burch says the use of puppy pads and paper training can be “tricky because you’re reinforcing two different options for the puppy.” In an ideal situation, pups would learn to hold it indoors and only eliminate at specific spots outdoors. But some cases may require a bit of creative thought, such as a person who has a job that makes it impossible to get home several times a day, or for a tiny dog living where the winters are brutal. Puppy pads give a dog the option of relieving herself in an approved spot at home. There are also high-tech indoor dog bathrooms that even work for male dogs. After the dog matures, the owner can then work on having the dog do her business outdoors all the time.",Create a Housetraining Schedule for Your Puppy,"It is vital to housetraining success. Puppies have tiny bladders, and water runs right through them. The same is true for solid matter. You have to make sure you are giving your puppy ample opportunity to do the right thing.

A good guide is that dogs can control their bladders for the number of hours corresponding to their age in months up to about nine months to a year. (Remember, though, that 10 to 12 hours is a long time for anyone to hold it!) A 6-month-old pup can reasonably be expected to hold it for about 6 hours. Never forget that all puppies are individuals and the timing will differ for each.

Monitor daily events and your puppy’s habits when setting up a schedule. With very young puppies, you should expect to take the puppy out:

• First thing in the morning

• Last thing at night

• After playing indoors

• After spending time in a crate

• Upon waking up from a nap

• After chewing a toy or bone

• After eating

• After drinking

This could have you running for the piddle pad, backyard, or street a dozen times or more in a 24-hour period. If you work, make some kind of arrangement (bringing your pup to the office or hiring a dog walker) to keep that schedule. The quicker you convey the idea that there is an approved place to potty and that some places are off-limits, the quicker you’ll be able to put this messy chapter behind you.",Train your puppy: To use a crate,"It’s not easy learning how to train a puppy, but crate training is an excellent way to help them settle into your home and get them on a schedule. Once your puppy adjusts to its new schedule he will learn to anticipate bathroom breaks and bedtime, making your life a lot easier. Diana Lipari, who breeds and shows beagles with the American Kennel Club, had these wise words for first time pet owners: “A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that once the dog is six months to a year they can let them roam freely. If they’re home by themselves they may get bored, they want something to do, and that means ripping up your sofa. So it’s always good to train puppies to love their crates. One way to do that is to give them treats every time they go in their crates and feed them from their crates. They’ll learn to love their crates and then you can leave them in the crates when you go out, as long as it’s not a really long time.” Check out the 13 unbelievable facts you never knew about your dog.",Train your puppy: To not bite,"Puppies like to nip a lot while their teeny-tiny canines grow in. But sometimes, they don’t realize just how hard their little bites can be. It’s important to teach them not to bite you or others while they’re still young. If your pet nips you too hard, say, “Ow!” in a loud, high-pitched voice similar to a puppy yelp. This will warn them that they bit too hard and tell them to back off. Give your doggie a treat or say, “Good boy/girl,” when they listen. Another clever alternative is to ignore them. Turning around and tucking your hands in your armpits acts as a calming signal, which is “a minor form of attention withdrawal,” Kathy Santos, a dog-training expert told the American Kennel Club. Never yell or physically punish your puppy because your furry friend will just interpret it as another form of attention, even if it’s negative. These are the 10 human foods your dog can safely eat."
how to stop a puppy from biting,Teach your puppy bite inhibition,"Learning how to moderate the force of a bite is very important for all dogs. There may come a time when they’re in pain or fearful, and they put their mouth on you or someone else. But if they’ve learned bite inhibition, they understand that they shouldn’t bite down hard. Puppies naturally nip at each other while playing. If they bite too hard on their mother or littermate, the other dog will likely make a loud yelp sound, warning the puppy, “Hey, that hurt!”

Depending on the dog, you can teach this, as well, by making a  high-pitched “ow!” sound if they bite you. Beware though, because, for some puppies, this actually gets them even more worked up and likely to bite. In this case, it is better to turn quietly around, walk away, or gently put the pup into their crate for a few minutes to calm down. If they do back off, be sure to reward your dog with a treat and some verbal praise.

Some dog owners use a bitter spray to deter puppies from chewing and biting on objects.",Teach your puppy that biting means “game over”,"If your puppy bites you while playing, that means playtime is over, with no exceptions. Yelling at or physically punishing your puppy, as strange as it sounds, is also a type of reward. It teaches them that biting gets some kind of response from you, which is known as positive punishment. This can also make them fearful of being handled. Instead, teach them that biting will get them nothing. Kathy Santo, dog trainer and columnist for AKC Family Dog, suggests turning around and tucking your hands into your armpits.

“It’s actually a calming signal and a minor form of attention withdrawal,” she says. “And be careful not to roughhouse with your young pup in ways that only encourage them to lose control and bite you.”",Inhibit the Biting,"The first step for how to get your puppy to stop biting is to inhibit the behavior. It is totally normal for puppies to mouth each other when they play. This mouthing, however, can quickly turn into a bite. When it does, the puppy on the receiving end will yelp, and this sound startles the puppy doing the biting, thus making him release.

Humans can exploit this behavior to stop puppy nipping and teach your pup how much mouthing is acceptable. When a puppy latches onto your hand or finger too hard, let your hand go limp and imitate that yelping sound. When the puppy releases, ignore her for 10 to 20 seconds and then resume play.

It’s important to remember, though, not to pull away from the bite. This can trigger your puppy’s chase instinct and make the problem worse. If the yelp doesn’t work or you’d prefer not to make that sound, you can substitute a loud “Ow!” or use other verbal deterrents.

Don’t repeat the limp and yelp process more than three times in 15 minutes. If you come to this point, it’s time for a puppy timeout.

The goal here is to teach the puppy that gentle play continues and rough play stops. Once you’ve inhibited the hard bites, repeat this teaching process with more moderate bites. Eventually, you should be able to teach her that mouthing without biting down is OK but that anything more than that is not.",Redirect,"If you’d like to teach your puppy that her mouth on human skin is not acceptable at all, you’ll most likely want to use the redirection method. For this method on how to make a puppy stop biting, each time the puppy tries to mouth you, pull your hand away before contact and promptly provide a treat or wave around a chewy toy for him to bite on instead.

You can also satisfy your puppy’s urge to mouth things with noncontact games such as fetch or tug-of-war. Keep in mind, however, to never let the tugging become too aggressive. You’ll want to teach your puppy the commands “let go” or “leave it” so that you can always remove something from his mouth without the response of aggressive puppy biting.",Distraction,"In addition to mouthing people, puppies will also mouth things in their environment. This is mostly done out of curiosity. There are many ways to teach your dog not to chew on house furnishings. Besides puppy-proofing your home, be sure to provide an assortment of interesting and safe chew toys for your pup to play with. These toys should be chosen for your puppy’s level of chewing and destructiveness. For example, if she shreds a plush toy in 2 minutes, you may want to stick toys made of rubber or hard plastic.

Hide-the-treat toys are also great for distracting puppies from nibbling on other things. This type of toy not only distracts your pup but also provides mental stimulation as she tries to figure out how to get to the reward.

A final option for distracting your pup is to arrange a playtime for your dog with other puppies or vaccinated adult dogs. Not only will this help to socialize her with other dogs, but those dogs will also assist in the process of teaching your puppy when a bite is too hard."
how to crate train a puppy,Where Should I Keep My Dog's Crate?,"The perfect spot for a dog crate is a location that’s quiet enough for your pup to rest but not so far off that they’re isolated from the household (so the garage or the basement are out). A corner of the living room, dining room or other area where family regularly gathers is an ideal location.

Crate location is particularly important at night, especially for young puppies who often need to go out for a potty trip at least once before morning. You’ll want to put the crate close enough to your bed that you can hear them ask to go out—and somewhere easy for you to get to, so you don’t have to fumble around in the middle of the night. If keeping the crate in your bedroom isn’t an option, consider using a dog monitor near the crate so you can hear when your puppy needs a potty trip.

It can be helpful to purchase two crates, especially for pet parents with larger dogs who require oversized crates that aren’t easy to move around. Keep one in the common area where your pup will hang out during the day, and one where they sleep at night.",How to Crate Train Your Dog: Tips and Tricks,"The following simple tips can help speed the crate training process:

• Always give your dog a potty break before putting them in the crate, and don’t forget to take them outside immediately after letting them out. This is especially important for puppies, whose ""hold time"" is still developing.

• Don’t crate your dog for too long. Doing so might force them to soil inside. Again, this is the biggest concern for puppies, whose “hold time” is roughly their age in months translated to hours. That means a 4-month-old puppy can hold it for about four hours. (Remember, play and excitement can make your pup need to go out more frequently, too.) For adult dogs, avoid crating them for more than four hours. That means that you should plan for a mid-day break if you'll be leaving your dog crated during the work day.

• Feeding your dog's meals in their crate with the door open can help to make it a positive spot. If they’re reluctant to eat inside, place the bowls next to the crate for a few meals, then just inside of it, then finally, at the back of the crate.

• Remember that there’s a difference between “frustration” noises and “I gotta go” noises. If you’ve just returned from a potty trip, a dog whining in the crate for the first few minutes is likely just settling in.

• The crate should never be used for punishment. Remember, the most important aspect of crate training is ensuring that your pup thinks it’s a fantastic place to hang out!",The Right Crate,"Once you start to look at crates you will find there are lots of options. Choosing the right crate for your own pup isn’t difficult once you consider a couple things:

• Type

• Size

First up is the type of crate, which can fall into two categories: either hard plastic airline-style crates, like the Frisco Two Door Top Load Plastic Dog & Cat Kennel, or wire crates like the Frisco Heavy Duty Fold & Carry Single Door Collapsible Wire Dog Crate. Most pups can learn to be comfortable in either type, but wire crates have more versatility when it comes to door placement and customizing the size of the interior with a divider.

Next, you’ll need to pick the correct size—one of the most important considerations when figuring out how to crate train a dog. Your dog crate should be large enough so that your dog can stand up, turn around and lie down comfortably, but not much bigger. Although it’s tempting to purchase an oversized crate to give your pup more room, doing so can derail the potty-training process by giving your pup the space to go to the bathroom at one end while staying dry in the other.

Pet parents of puppies, especially large breed puppies, can anticipate their dog's growth by purchasing the largest sized crate their dog will need when they’re fully grown and using an adjustable crate divider to keep the available space inside the right size. The Frisco Fold & Carry Double Door Collapsible Wire Dog Crate comes with a divider and is available in sizes up to XL, so your crate can grow right along with your puppy.",Reward your puppy and create a positive experience,"The best way to find success in crate training, and one of the best puppy training tips in general, is to reward your puppy frequently. This way, they develop a positive association with the crate.

Another great way to create this association is to play crate games. You might line up a trail of kibble to the crate or play a game of fetch where the toy lands inside the crate and your dog has to retrieve it. These types of games can make the dog crate more approachable and fun.

Remember: Crate training, like all puppy training, requires time and patience – and despite your best efforts, the unexpected can still happen.

There may be crying, there may be barking or puppy may pee in the crate at night. Don’t worry, it will get better!

The key to success is to place the crate right beside your bed for the first few nights or weeks. Remember, you don’t want your dog to associate her crate with you leaving! She should be close enough that you can stick your fingers in the crate. If she vocalizes at night, tell her she’s a good puppy and put your fingers in the crate. She’ll appreciate the company and should settle back in and go right to sleep.

If puppy doesn’t settle after a few minutes, she probably needs to go outside. Just pick her up and don’t talk with her or fuss over her. She needs to know she’s being let out for business, not for fun …

So try to interact with her as little as possible. Nighttime is for sleeping, not for fun!

how to potty train a puppy,Get your puppy on a feeding schedule,"One good way to get pottying under control is to put your puppy on a feeding schedule. In addition to pottying right after eating, many puppies potty again some regular period of time after eating. If you note a) when you feed your puppy and b) when your puppy potties between meals, you can start to find patterns. Use your notes to make sure your puppy always goes out to a potty area at the right times after eating.

With a feeding schedule, you give your puppy regular meals, at regular times, rather than leaving the food bowl out all the time. Fixed meal times make it easier to set up a schedule of potty breaks. The right feeding schedule depends on age, size and more, so ask your veterinarian to help you figure out a feeding schedule for your puppy.",MORE BLOGS FROM RICHELL USA!,"The Importance of a Clean Litter Box

It sounds like stating the obvious. But it’s an important mindset to start out with—potty training, especially in the beginning, is not about trying to punish your dog for going inside. It’s about ensuring they always have the opportunity to go outside.

To that end, the real training begins with dog owners.

how much to feed a puppy,WHAT TO FEED YOUR PUPPY,"Before jumping into how much food you need to feed your puppy, you should be aware of what you should feed your puppy. There are many factors to consider at this point. These include:

NUTRITION

Puppies require specially formulated food containing multiple nutrients to meet their nutritional requirements. They need a balanced diet so that they receive the proper nutrition they require to grow into healthy dogs.

Protein‐rich puppy food formulas are a great option for puppies as it helps support their growing muscles. Carbohydrates provide them with the energy they need to remain active and playful, while calcium supports in the healthy development of teeth and bones. Moreover, DHA present in the formula helps support in the development of a healthy brain and vision.",SIZE OF THE BREED,"A large breed puppy will need a large breed‐specific puppy formula, whereas small puppy breeds can benefit from small breed‐specific formulas. However, despite the size of the puppy’s breed, the food should be balanced for the growing pups.

The difference between the formulas is mainly due to the unique nutritional requirements of small and large breeds. Larger dogs are faced with the potential risk of joint problems due to their size, so largebreed puppy formulas help supply them with additional nutrients to support their joints. On the other hand, small breed puppies prefer munching on smaller kibble since it is easier to chew. Moreover, it alsoprovides them with all the nutrients they need. Smaller breed puppies also have a higher metabolic rate, which is why they require more nutrient‐dense and higher‐energy food.",TYPE OF FOOD,"When it comes to feeding your puppy food, dry kibble is usually the popular choice. However, it is not the only available option as you also have wet puppy food. This choice can make it difficult to decide theright food for your puppy. However, you don’t need to fret. As long as both wet and dry formulas are complete and balanced, you can feed them to your pup without any hesitation.

You also have the option of feeding your puppy a combination of both. However, you need to make sure that the combined amounts don’t exceed your puppy’s daily calorie intake. Never take the risk of overfeeding your puppy as it can lead to obesity. You should rather focus on helping it maintain an ideal body condition as it grows.",Puppy Feeding Tidbits,"• Feeding your pup the moment you get home may encourage puppy separation anxiety. Play or grooming is a more positive way to say hello.

• When medically necessary, you can purchase canned or dry prescription diets from veterinarians to feed dogs with kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes, and other serious conditions. These foods should never be fed without a prescription.

• Some vitamin or mineral supplements, when utilized incorrectly (such as extra calcium given to a large-breed dog on a good diet), will do more harm than good.

• Before making a major change in your dog’s diet, consult with your veterinarian and, when possible, the breeder. Once the formula is chosen, stick with it. Sudden changes in food may cause digestion problems.

• Small portions of carrot or apple chunks are healthful low-calorie snacks most dogs love.

• Fresh water should be available at all times. During the summer months, consider setting up multiple indoor/outdoor water stations. To avoid a buildup of bacteria, wash the water bowl daily.",Puppy Feeding Advice,"Make sure everyone gets with the program

Your entire household must be committed to your dog’s feeding regimen. If there’s a soft touch for a handout in your family, your dog will find it and exploit it, thus undoing the good you are trying to do. Keeping a dog trim takes a conscious effort from everyone on your team.

Give a dog a bone? Careful!

Our best advice here is caution. Poultry and pork bones, or cooked bones of any kind, are strictly forbidden. They splinter into shards that can cause choking and serious damage to the dog’s mouth, throat, or intestines. Any bone, in fact, once chewed into small pieces, can block the intestines and lead to a nasty bout of constipation, can cause lacerations of the mouth and internal organs, or can lodge in the throat with fatal results. It is important to note that bones have little if any nutritional value.

There are other ways to satisfy a dog’s craving to chew. Commercially available chew toys and simulated bones are made for dogs of all sizes.

As the famous food writer M.F.K. Fisher wrote, “First we eat. Then we do everything else.” This is true for our pups, too."
how long does it take to potty train a puppy,When You Wake Up,"Each day begins the same for you and your puppy. When the alarm clock goes off, wake up and get your puppy out of the crate and outside to do their business. Don’t stop to make coffee, check emails, or brush your teeth.

Keeping the crate in or near your bedroom lets you hear a whimper or a whine if your pup needs to go out during the night or before your alarm sounds. When they’re still small, you may be able to pick your pup out of the crate to carry them outside. This will prevent them from stopping and peeing on the floor on the way to the door.

Always head out the same door to the same area where you want your puppy to potty, and keep them on a leash outside while training (even in a fenced yard), so you can see what’s happening and react immediately.",After Meals,"Another morning ritual will be breakfast. After you take your puppy out to potty, they will be ready for their first meal of the day. Try to keep this scheduled at the same time each day. This will aid in regulating elimination, so you can set your watch to potty time.

After the meal, only wait between 5 and 30 minutes to take your puppy outside. The younger the puppy, the sooner they should be brought out after a meal to potty. As the puppy grows older, they will gain bladder control and learn to hold it longer each day. Most puppies eat three to four meals a day when they are growing, and most puppies will have to poop after meals, so paying attention to this short follow-up period is important.

Also, remain watchful when the puppy drinks water. Treat this just like a meal, and take them out to potty soon afterward. Choosing a puppy food that digests well and avoiding feeding within two hours of bedtime will help.",After Playtime And Naps,"There are many other times that a young puppy will need to go potty, besides the first thing in the morning and after each meal. These instances include periods after naps and playtime.

Naps are mini-versions of the morning routine. Make sure that whenever your puppy is sleeping, you take them outside the moment they wake up.

During playtime, the stimulation of the digestive tract may also give your pup the urge to have a potty break. Some seemingly random clues that a puppy needs to go out can include sniffing the floor or carpet, wandering away from the family, becoming overexcited with zoomies, whimpering, or running to the door. If you see any of these signs, take your puppy out to potty immediately.",How long does it take to potty train a puppy? ,"It takes three or four weeks to potty train most puppies, but …

It depends!

There’s no magic age or amount of time, but people generally set their expectations too high. Potty training a puppy takes longer than some puppy owners realize.

It depends on the puppy and the consistency of the person.

With my weimaraner puppy, it took about 6 weeks for the potty training to “click.”

I got him when he was 8 weeks old and once he was 14 weeks I realized he hadn’t had an accident in a long time. He definitely was not 100 percent potty trained yet. But close.

Six weeks may seem fast but during that time I kept thinking, when will my puppy “get it”? It got really old taking him out 12 or 13 times a day, but it paid off.",It takes 2 or more weeks to potty train a puppy,"I get a lot of emails that say things like:

“I just got a puppy and I’ve been taking her out every 2 hours but she still goes potty in the house. She just isn’t getting it!”

And when I ask how long they’ve had the puppy, it’s usually a short time like 3 or 4 days or maybe two weeks at the most!

It takes at least two weeks to fully potty train a puppy. Most puppies will need 4 to 8 weeks or even longer.

It’s very simple to potty train a puppy, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. It’s hard work. I had to take Remy out literally 13 times a day. Every day. For several weeks.

Some puppies are easier to potty train than others

Here are some reasons why potty training my Weimaraner puppy was pretty easy:

1. Weimaraners seem pretty easy to potty train because they’re smart! Some breeds may be more challenging. Just be consistent.

2. Larger breeds in general seem fairly easy to potty train. This might be because their owners are more consistent or maybe they can hold it longer.

3. I worked from home and had a flexible schedule. I took Remy out every hour. Not everyone can do that.

So you see, it took me 6 weeks to potty train my puppy, but I had the luxury of a flexible schedule.

If it’s taking your puppy a little longer, don’t worry. That’s OK! It’s not fair to compare your puppy to others. Just stick to your routine and he will get it with time.

what time is the puppy bowl 2022,What is the Puppy Bowl?,"The Puppy Bowl certainly goes above and beyond your typical game of fetch, with the puppy participants playing on a mock football field in colored bandana “uniforms.” With cameras installed all over, including inside the pups’ shared water bowl, viewers can take in the action from all angles.

how to stop puppy biting,Puppies Are Jerks — That’s Why They’re So Cute,"If you have a puppy chances are you’re asking yourself “what in the world have I gotten myself into?” Trust me, you’re not alone. Puppies are a handful, and their constant biting can be extremely frustrating.

Why do puppies bite so much anyway? Puppies are just like babies in a few ways; they’re curious, they can be fussy, and they’re just starting to learn about the world around them. And guess what they use to explore this new world? Yep, those sharp little teeth of theirs.

Sure their litter mates and mom taught them a few things, but now it’s up to you to continue the process. And that includes teaching them not to bite humans.

Puppies bite everything, and they bite a lot, and some breeds tend to bite more than others. It’s their way of exploring and learning about the people and things that surround them. While it might be funny for a minute it gets old pretty quick, especially if you’re the one on the receiving end.

Teaching your puppy not to bite is one of the first things you’re going to want to work on, especially if you have children.

Training a puppy isn’t on my list of fun and enjoyable activities; it’s a lot of hard work and as I said puppies are jerks. There’s a reason they’re so cute and that sole reason is to keep us from harming them. It doesn’t take long for the cuteness of a puppy to wear off as you find yourself constantly prying their mouth off of everything.",Bite Inhibition: Learning to Fill In The Gaps,"One of the first things your new puppy needs to learn is how to how to control that mouth of his. And to do that you’re going to have to start teaching them some bite inhibition.

Bite inhibition is a learned response where your dog consciously inhibits the force of his bite. Dogs start learning this behavior at a young age from their litter mates, but now you have to fill in the gaps.

Your puppy probably has a decent foundation of this behavior. While pups are nursing the mother dog will stand up and walk away if one of the pups bites too hard. When puppies are playing with their siblings they’ll yelp and stop playing if someone gets too rough. But problems can arise when the pup is introduced to his new human family and those same boundaries aren’t set and reinforced.

The good news is that this biting behavior isn’t permanent, the bad news is that it’s not always easy to train them out of their biting behavior (not to mention how much those puppy teeth hurt). As with us humans, each dog is different, and some dogs will require more consistency to break this nasty habit.",How to Teach Bite Inhibition With a Clicker,"• Place your hand in front of your pup’s mouth, if he doesn’t bite give him a click, treat, and praise like crazy.

• When you’re comfortable that your pup isn’t going to bite your hand when you place it in front of his face you can up the ante.

• Start by slowly waving your hand in front of him, if he doesn’t bite it praise, click and treat.

Your goal here is to teach your puppy not to bite everything that comes near his face. Don’t set him up to fail. Start slowly, his first reaction might very well be to bite anything that comes near him.

Click and treat for small inhibitions and gradually up the stimuli. If you’re consistent you should end up with a puppy that isn’t going to reach out and try to bite anything that moves.

Just remember this activity will take a lot of practice. You’re building up his impulse control which isn’t something that can be trained in just a few sessions. Puppies need to learn boundaries and how to control their impulses just as children do. They need to learn that good things come to those that wait, or in this case good things come to puppies that don’t bite.",How Can I Stop My Puppy From Biting?,"why

Here’s an exact quote from one of our readers:

That was actually just one of a laundry list of questions Stella’s dad had about Stella the bouncy 8 1/2 week old Labrador Retriever puppy.

So the question is how do you stop puppy biting.

A mouthy, bitey, nippy, puppy is perfectly normal and I would actually be surprised if you were not experiencing some growing pains with a nippy puppy.

As I said earlier I’ve been raising puppies for a while now and some of the others in my group have been puppy raisers for 25+ years and raised a dozen or more puppies in the guide dog program.

Every time I see them with a new puppy I inevitably see little dagger like puncture marks on their hands and wrists.

Even a seasoned puppy raiser usually ends up with some collateral damage from these playful guide pups.

There is some good news. Most puppies can be trained to regulate and minimize their biting pretty easily.

For beginner artists, starting with simple shapes such as lines and circles is the easiest way to learn how to draw a dog. For a profile (sideways facing) dog, begin by drawing a curved line downwards. This will form your dog’s head, neck, back, and tail. Sketch a circle at the highest end of your curved line, with an oval to the left side for your dog’s nose.

Add two circles, a larger one on the left and a smaller one on the right, and connect these together underneath with a slightly curved line. Draw a straight line from the head circle down to the left circle to create your dog’s long neck.

Step 2: Finish Your Simple Dog Outline

To complete your outline, draw a tube shape underneath the larger circle with a small square and oval. Under the smaller circle, draw two curved lines, a tube shape, and another oval. Your dog now has legs! Finally, add a thin, curved tube from the top of the smaller circle to give your dog a tail.

Step 3: Add Basic Facial Features

At the end of the oval on your dog’s head, draw a small square and shade this in to give your dog a nose. Lightly trace along the underside of the oval until you’re around halfway toward the head circle and draw a slightly curved line upwards to create a mouth.

Sketch a small square and shade this in to create a realistic eye for your dog. Finally, no pup is complete without some scratchable ears! To complete the profile, draw a soft triangular shape pointing downwards from the middle of the head circle to the far edge of the circle. The two sides should meet at the base of the circle to form the tip of the ear.

Now you’re ready to try more complex techniques such as detailed facial features and fur!",How to Draw a Dog Face,"Step 1: Start With Basic Shapes

When you’re learning how to draw a dog face, starting with basic shapes is the simplest method for new artists and those looking to build their confidence.

Using your pencil, start your dog outline by drawing a circle with a horizontal line through the middle of the circle. Follow this with a vertical line crossing over it within the circle. This will create a guiding point for your dog’s eyes and facial features. Directly underneath the horizontal guideline, draw an oval that stretches down to the end of the vertical line to create your dog’s muzzle.

Step 2: Frame the Face

Draw a flat line across the top of the circle with a slanted line down each side. From the ends of the slanted lines, draw a connecting line on each side down to meet the oval. Place two small circles at either end of the horizontal guideline to create your dog’s eyes. Make sure that these are the same size and distance from the central vertical line.

Step 3: Add Realistic Features

Where and how to add a nose to your dog sketch depends on the breed you’re drawing and the angle that you want the head to be facing you. If your dog is looking straight ahead, you’ll want to place the nose directly underneath your initial circle. Think of this as an upside-down triangle but with a curve for the top side. From the tip of the nose, draw a straight line down with an arrow pointing up to create your dog’s mouth.

There are many different ways that you can add noses, mouths, and ears, so it can be helpful to try out a few different variations on a separate piece of paper before you add them to your dog drawing. Once you’ve decided on the style that you want to use, you can finish your drawing!",How to Draw Fur,"Step 1: Create a Base Layer

Lightly erase the pencil markings of your dog outline until it is barely visible. This helps your fur stand out and creates a more realistic image where the fur gives the illusion of the dog’s body rather than the fixed lines from your original sketch.

Using a sharpened pencil, shade a soft base layer everywhere that you’d like your dog drawing to have fur in this color. Hold your pencil further back with your hand to create an even lighter tone and go back and forth in the direction of the fur.

Once you’ve completed the first layer, continue to go back over the shading several times with a small increase in pencil pressure each time. This will give your drawing more depth before you add in the fur details.

Step 2: Add Fur Lines

Fur lines are short pencil strokes that depict the hairs on your dog. You can draw these closer together or further apart depending on the breed of dog and style of fur that you’re trying to draw. It’s helpful to practice these before adding them onto your final drawing to make sure that you like the final look.

For silkier breeds of dog, long and soft fur lines will give the appearance of a smooth coat. Shorter, jagged lines are best for short-hair breeds or if you’re trying to give your dog a messier look.

A good place to start with fur lines is around the edges of your dog drawing. This will help you see where natural movement of the body would be before adding in the rest of the fur. From here, you can start to vary the strokes of your pencil to reflect different fur patterns across your dog.

When you’re ready, draw your fur lines on top of your base layer in the coloring pencil of your choice to finish your dog drawing.",Dog Drawing Instructions,"Step 1

Start by drawing an oval shape. You can make a perfect oval or make it to be a bit more “boxy”. Nothing wrong if it’s more round. This will be the snout.

Step 2

Continue by making a inverted U shape above the oval you have previously drawn. This will be the head. Also make the nose. You can make it round or more of a triangle shape.

Step 3

Draw the ears. We think droopy or folded ears are the best, but you could also draw pointy, button or any other shape you want.

Step 4

Lets finish up the dog face. Draw two spots for eyes and two arches above the eyes for the eyebrows. Draw a straight line from the snout and a wavy line for the mouth.

Also make the front pair of legs.

Step 5

Time to make the body!

Step 6

Last but not lest, draw a pair of hind legs and a wiggly tail.

Congratulations you have learned how to draw a dog.

how to stop puppy from biting,Teach Bite Inhibition,"As puppies grow, they tend to play bite as they wrestle with their littermates.

In these situations, if they bite down too hard on the other animal, this can earn them a warning bite or yelp in return. The pain the puppy feels at that warning bite, or the unexpected yelping sound, snaps them out of their bite and causes them to release the other dog.

To mimic this effect in your home, try letting out a loud, high-pitched “Ow!” when your puppy nips you. In some dogs, this will cause them to release you and back off.

Beware, though: Yelping can cause some dogs to get more riled up and make them more likely to bite.

If this is your dog, it’s best to turn quietly around and walk away, or put the puppy in their crate for a while to calm down.",End Playtime,"If your puppy bites while playing, make sure they know it means that playtime is over, no exceptions.

Yelling at or punishing your puppy for nipping may seem to be a way to get your message across, but it actually has the opposite effect. Rather than showing your dog that their behavior is unacceptable, they learn that biting gets them attention, and they’ll continue biting.

Instead, put your puppy down and quietly walk away. Tuck your hands into your armpits to make yourself seem physically smaller, sending a signal to your puppy that they no longer have your attention.

This will help them see that the things they do impact your attention, and they will learn to avoid the behaviors that cause you to walk away.",Why do puppies bite?,"Puppies explore and experience the world with their mouths. This means that everything they come in contact with, including human fingers and toes, will eventually be subjected to mouthing, nipping, or biting. They are also exuberant and full of energy. These two typical puppy traits often translate into rough play, as well as biting behavior. This does not mean you have a vicious-dog-in-training on your hands. It means you have a normal puppy who loves to do normal puppy stuff—and who needs to be trained and socialized not to nip. Unless your dog has had bad experiences and is fearful of people or their environment, he is not biting out of self-defense or trying to inflict pain. Here’s the thing: How to stop a puppy from biting has everything to do with you and what you teach him is acceptable. Letting your puppy bite you during play (or ever) is one of the puppy-training mistakes lots of new dog owners make—and regret later.",Chew on this,"Just like human babies, puppies go through a teething phase. And, just like babies, they try to soothe their irritated, painful gums by chewing on anything they can fit into their mouths. “Puppy biting is universal,” says Ali Mason, DVM, Medical Director at VCA Hope Animal Hospital. “All puppies bite, simply due to teething. The most aggressive teething phase for puppies is between two and six months old.” Where puppies and human babies should differ is in your response to their teething behavior. Dr. Mason cautions that you can’t stop teething in puppies altogether, but stresses that you can teach your puppy not to bite you. Biting due to teething should be treated the same way that biting during rough play and exploration is handled.",Arm yourself with chew toys,"Puppies will be puppies, so rule #1 is to make sure they have things to bite, mouth, and chew that are approved by you for that use. It will be much harder to wean them off your fingers (and favorite shoes) if they don’t have toys of their own they can play with. “Chewing is a natural behavior for a dog, and it’s important to provide puppies with safe ways to chew, to help satiate that behavior,” says Erin Askeland, a certified professional dog trainer and canine behavior consultant at Camp Bow Wow. “Options may include safe bones, rubber items like Kongs, and stuffed toys designed for puppies. If they don’t have access to these items, puppies will find other things to chew and bite on.”

Simply having a chew-toy arsenal on hand is not enough, however. To solidify appropriate chewing behavior in your dog, always swap out what they shouldn’t be chewing on for an approved toy, suggests Gary Weitzman, DVM, president and CEO of the San Diego Humane Society. Dr. Weitzman also suggests praising your puppy for chewing on appropriate items. “Puppies spend three to five hours a day chewing, so it’s incredibly important to leave appropriate items around the house for them to pick up and chew,” he adds.

when do puppies lose their baby teeth,The Development of Puppy Teeth,"Before we talk about when puppies lose their teeth, let’s look at the puppy dentition. Puppies start getting teeth once they start the weaning process, and this typically starts around five to six weeks of age, and for some breeds, it might not start until eight weeks of age. The puppy dentition contains a total of 28 baby teeth, and puppies are known to have sharp, pointy baby teeth that can wreak havoc on not just your shoes, but your hands, arms, and fingers too.

When Do Puppies Get Their Teeth?

Puppy teeth erupt at about two weeks of age and are usually completely in by about eight to ten weeks old. The incisors erupt first, followed by the canine teeth, the premolars, and the molars, although there is some variation between breeds.",How Long Do Puppies Teethe?,"Teething is a process that can last for months and starts when puppies are around two weeks old when the first baby teeth start to come in. The teething process itself usually ends at around eight to nine months of age, when all the adult teeth have erupted. If you have ever had a puppy, you know that during the teething process, it’s important to provide them with appropriate chew toys to relieve the discomfort that comes with teething.

Caring For Your Puppy While Teething

If your puppy is healthy and happy, and is playful, eating, drinking, and socializing normally, teething shouldn’t be an issue. However, if your puppy seems painful, reluctant to eat or play, then an appointment with your veterinarian is recommended. The best thing to do for your teething puppy is to offer safe chew toys, and your veterinarian can make recommendations. The best items for teething puppies are toys that are soft and flexible and bend easily. Toys that are too hard to bend, and don’t in your hand, might be too hard on your puppy’s mouth and can actually break these fragile young teeth.",What Can I Do When My Puppy Starts Losing Teeth?,"Veterinarians recommend letting baby teeth fall out on their own, and don’t advise trying to pull loose teeth out yourself. Baby teeth have long roots, and pulling a loose tooth can break a root, leaving the broken part behind and leading to possible infection. In dogs who have retained baby teeth, where the baby tooth is in the way of an emerging permanent tooth, you may have to make a dental appointment with your veterinarian to have those baby teeth pulled. This is a common issue in some toy breeds, such as Yorkshire terriers, where the baby tooth remains in place, preventing the adult tooth from coming in properly, and as a result, causing an occlusion, or bite, problem. Periodontal issues can also arise when there is the crowding of baby and adult teeth, and this can lead to bad breath and the build-up of dental plaque and tartar.",Weeks 12 to 16:,"This is around the time you’ll get to take your puppy home with you (some breeders let puppies go to their new owners’ homes at 8 weeks, but others wait an extra month or so, depending on the breed and the individual breeder’s preferences).

This is also the time when may start to find little crumb- to rice-sized teeth around your home as your puppy’s baby teeth start to shed and permanent adult teeth emerge. Anyone who has ever cared for a teething baby knows this process is painful! You should offer your puppy safe chew toys, like a Kong or Treat Pod toy, at this point in his development. Also, ask your vet to check your puppy’s mouth to make sure everything is moving along as it should.

This period is also important for socialization — that is, getting your puppy used to new experiences in a low-stress situation. There’s a lot involved in this process, but since we’re on the topic of teeth here, this is a good time to start touching your puppy’s mouth, outside and in. (Be careful that he doesn’t nip you — those remaining puppy teeth are razor sharp.) By doing this, you’ll be setting your puppy up to be able to enjoy (or at least tolerate) getting his teeth brushed.",Keeping the Teeth Healthy,"Now that your puppy has a full mouth of pearly white chompers, your job is to keep them that way. Dogs don’t have the sense to use their tongue to dislodge chewed food from their teeth—that combined with plaque in the mouth can lead to dog with stinky breath, if periodontal disease occurs, serious medical problems.

By brushing your pup’s teeth regularly, you can prevent or decrease the need for veterinary cleanings, which usually require anesthetizing the dog.

Begin by gently scrubbing the teeth with a finger brush or gauze pad. Later you can graduate to a toothbrush and canine toothpaste. Toothbrushes should be soft, and toothpaste must be formulated for a dog’s system (an enzymatic toothpaste will work both mechanically and chemically to destroy plaque). Toothpaste made for people can cause an upset stomach if your pup swallows it. Teeth can also be cleaned with a paste made of baking soda and water.

Also, certain foods, treats, and other products are available to help reduce plaque. Look for products that have a seal of approval from the Veterinary Oral Health Council. A list is available here. For more help with your teething puppy, check out our puppy teething pack which includes toys, treats, and more!

how big will my puppy get,How Big Will My Puppy Get?,"In general, an adult average-sized dog at 12 months old weighs about 2-1/2 times their weight at 14 weeks or twice their weight at four months of age. But these are over-generalized estimates that don’t take some other factors into account, including:

• Breed: Dogs’ growth rates and full-grown size vary widely by breed type. See our section below that breaks down breed sizes.• Parents: If you’re lucky enough to see your puppy’s parents, you can get a pretty good idea of how big your puppy will get based on their sizes.• Gender: As with humans, male puppies will typically be larger than females.• Neutering/Spaying: Puppies that are neutered or spayed early can weigh a bit more and be slightly taller than average as adults. Why? The procedure can somewhat alter the chemical signals that tell the body to stop growing on its normal path.",Puppyhood Is The Best Time To Consider Pet Insurance,"As a puppy, your dog has probably not shown any significant health concerns at his young age. Since pet insurance companies do not cover pre-existing conditions, the younger your dog is when you sign up, the better coverage you will likely receive throughout his lifetime. Further, pet insurance can help support you financially during the unpredictable puppy years when dogs are more likely to chew on things they shouldn’t and run into dangerous situations. Check out our pet insurance 101 guide to learn more and determine whether pet insurance is worth it for your puppy.

Is Paw Size A Good Predictor?

You may have heard that a puppy’s paw size can give you an idea of how big your puppy will get, but that’s not always an accurate predictor. Why? Paw size can depend on the breed. For example, there are some large dog breeds, like Collies, that have small paws for their size. And some small to medium-sized breeds, like Bulldogs, have large paws for their size.",Is Paw Size A Good Predictor?,"You may have heard that a puppy’s paw size can give you an idea of how big your puppy will get, but that’s not always an accurate predictor. Why? Paw size can depend on the breed. For example, there are some large dog breeds, like Collies, that have small paws for their size. And some small to medium-sized breeds, like Bulldogs, have large paws for their size.

As we mentioned above, a dog’s growth rate varies by breed. So there are different formulas to predict their adult weight by the general breed size. Dog breeds are generally broken into five categories by size, but keep in mind there is some overlap with dogs on the lower and higher end of each category.

• Toy (up to 12 pounds)• Small (12-25 pounds)• Medium (25-50 pounds)• Large (50-100 pounds)• Giant (over 100 pounds)",What can you use to predict your puppy’s size?,"Here are a couple of rule-of-thumb guides to predict your pup’s adult weight.

Firstly, if your dog had puppies, an average newborn doubles their birthweight by one week of age. After that, their weight gain is a cumulative 5 – 10 % increase day on day.

But by six weeks of age, small and big dogs gain weight very differently. Small breeds tend to gain 5 oz. a week, with larger breeds gaining nearly six times this at around 2lb 5 oz. a week.

Toy and Small Breeds

The first insight into their ultimate adult weight again comes at six weeks of age. Simply take their six-week weight, double it, and then double it again. For example, a 1 lb. puppy at six weeks old will weigh around 4lb as an adult.

Medium and Large Breeds

You have to wait a bit longer for these guys because it’s their 14 week age you use as a predictor. Also, the math is a bit more complicated. To work it out you double the pup’s 14 week age and then add on half of the original 14-week weight.

For example, a 20lb puppy at 14 weeks is predicted to weigh 20 + 20 + 10, which adds up to 50lb

For these guys, another weight landmark is the six-month point. This is the age when the pup weighs approximately two-thirds of his expected adult weight. Although that said, giant dogs are only approaching half their adult weight at this age.",Another Way of Working Out Adult Size,"Maybe you adopted the pup late and don’t know their six-week weight. What’s to be done?

OK, try this alternative calculation to get an idea what to expect.

Whilst the formula remains the same for toy through to giant dogs, what’s different is their age when you measure their weight.

First of all the formula:

Take the pup’s weight in pounds (at a certain age) and divide it by his age in weeks, then multiply that number by 52 (the number of weeks in a year). This should predict your pup’s ideal adult weight.

• Small breeds Weigh at 12 weeks old

• Medium sized breeds Weigh at 16 weeks old

• Large breed pups Weigh at 20 weeks old

OK, so let’s say a medium-sized dog weighs 8 lbs. at 16 weeks. How heavy will he be as an adult?

8 (lbs.) divided by 16 (weeks) equals 0.5

Multiply 0.5 by 52 (0.5 x 52) = 26 lbs. predicted adult weight.

Let’s try again with a small dog weighing 3 lbs. at 12 weeks old

3 divided by 12 = 0.25

0.25 x 52 = 13 lbs. predicted adult dog

how to get a puppy to stop biting,Play with a purpose,"Ever heard the saying, “A tired dog is a good dog?”If you spend plenty of time playing with and walking your puppy to expend some of their bounding puppy energy, it’ll be easier to focus during short play training sessions.

When training your puppy to stop biting you, it’s important to discourage unacceptable biting behavior and encourage acceptable behavior. But that takes some work. When you’re just getting started, you can discourage your puppy from biting your hands or feet by crying out in a high pitched “ow!” when you’re bitten. Allow your hand or foot to go limp and stop playing for a moment. (Make sure not to yank your hand away, however, or your pup may think it’s a game.) Praise your pup if they stop or lick you and then get back to playing.

If yelping and pausing doesn’t do the trick, try a short time out. When your pup bites you, remove your hands (maybe even tuck them into your armpits), step away, ignore her for 10 to 30 seconds, and then resume gentle play. When she plays nicely, offer plenty of praise, snuggles, and perhaps some treats!",Use toys in training,"Now that you know what toys to try; here’s the scoop on how to use them to keep your puppy from biting you.

Just as with your previous play training, remove your hand or foot when your puppy uses her teeth. Instead of just ignoring her, give her a toy to chew on and praise her when she turns her attention to the toy.

Keep a favorite toy or small treats nearby during non-playtimes, too, because puppies often gnaw on fingers when we pet and snuggle them. If your puppy tries to snack on a finger, offer a treat or toy with one hand, and pet with the other. This is another tried and true way to help puppies understand what’s okay to chew on.

Toys can also be helpful for puppies who like to pounce on and bite feet while we walk. Try directing your puppy’s attention away from your feet by carrying a beloved toy by your side. If he tries to bite you, toss the toy his way instead!

Conclusion

By following these tips, your puppy will be a pro playmate in no time! But if you still have trouble with biting, mouthing, and nipping after sticking to these strategies for a few weeks—or if you suspect your puppy bites out of fear or aggression rather than curiosity and playfulness—call up a professional trainer.

Start by making a yelp sound if your puppy tries to bite you. You can also try to distract your puppy with a chew toy. Another option, walk away from your puppy. This may not work if you are trying to get a puppy to stop biting your feet. In that case, you may want to consider using a longer rope toy to distract your puppy.

Whenever your puppy tries to bite, give a firm no command. Do not yell at your puppy or bite your puppy. You also can consider using a short puppy time out to teach your dog this biting behavior is unacceptable.

Wondering how long puppies bite? By the time your dog reaches 15 weeks, you should have already given him proper training techniques and basic commands to get your dog to stop his annoying mouthing behavior. Training your puppy can be as simple as taking him to a puppy class to help him learn the necessary obedience commands.

The good news: the puppy biting stage is short. Most dogs stop biting after they finish teething, which is typically at six months.

If your dog is older or if you have adopted a dog that’s older than 15 weeks and is new to your home, then you may wonder how to train your puppy not to bite.

Use the following tips to help you get your dog to stop biting your hands and biting at your fingers, biting your hands, biting your feet, or toes or ankles, or any other body parts.",Types of Biting: Aggression or Play?,"Puppies use their teeth in many ways. Sometimes, it’s difficult for their owners to read their body language and determine the meaning behind the mouth.

Puppy Play Can Look Aggressive

When you watch littermates tussle in a ball of fur and fury, it can sound like they’re killing each other. However, this is actually just very intense play.

Play biting can be accompanied with growling and snarling. This is just part of the fun to a young pup.

We won’t spend a lot of time discussing aggressive biting in this article. Instead, we will look into how we can prevent playful mouthing.

However, it is important to recognize the signs of aggression.

How To Tell if Your Puppy’s Biting is Aggressive

If you see a hard stare, the hair standing up on their back, lip licking, closed mouth, low growling or a statue-like, tense body posture and then a bite, the meaning behind it isn’t so friendly.

Pay attention to the timing of the biting as well. Does it happen after a puppy temper tantrum where you ask the pup to do something they don’t want to do? If so, the motive behind the bite may be more aggressive.

Could it be Resource Guarding?

Some dogs also aggressively bite when they are guarding a toy or food item, commonly called resource guarding.

With resource guarding, you will see the same behavior as aggressive biting, but they will also stand over an object and defend it from any perceived threat.

If you think your puppy is behaving aggressively, seek professional help to learn how to actively manage this issue.

In contrast to this, playing puppies will be relaxed and have a wiggly body. They will be bouncy, easily roll onto their backs and often be panting with open mouths.

Even if they are growling, a relaxed face and body mean a happy puppy."
when do puppies stop growing,How Long Do Puppies Grow?,"Although all puppies are officially considered adult dogs once they reach one year old, puppies continue to grow in height and size while their bones are still developing, which takes anywhere from 6 to 24 months. Their skeletal growth is what determines how tall they will become as adults.

“The long bones in a puppy’s legs grow from two distinct places called growth plates, according to Dr. Jerry Klein, DVM and Chief Veterinary Officer at AKC. “The growth plates are somewhat flexible and soft during puppyhood when new tissue is being formed.”

As your pooch grows, the new tissue developed hardens into bone. “When the growth plates have stopped producing new tissue and become completely calcified, they are said to have ‘closed,’ which means that they’ve stopped growing and the bone has reached its final size,” says Dr. Klein.

Keep in mind, even after the bones are fully developed, your puppy will continue to develop fat and muscle, just as human adults do.",How Do I Feed a Growing Puppy?,"Foods that meet the nutritional guidelines set up by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and are specifically designed for all life stages will provide your developing pup all the nutrition they need. These foods also don’t require a transition onto an adult-specific food when pups are fully grown.

“Those foods designated for ‘all life stages’ mean that they meet needs of both growing and adult animals,” according to Dr. Klein. You’ll also find puppy-specific foods that ensure your pooch gets all the nutrients she needs, but you’ll only want to feed those until adulthood — around 11 to 14 months of age.

Most importantly, always follow the guidelines on the food when feeding your puppy so the pooch doesn’t become overweight. “It is known that obesity in puppies can lead to a predisposition of future orthopedic issues later in life, such as hip dysplasia, so a fit, leaner puppy is considered preferable to a chubby older puppy,” warns Dr. Klein.","How Do Puppies Grow, Anyway?","Anatomically speaking, dogs grow in much the same way that human children do – especially as it concerns height.

It’s easy to intuit the growth of your puppy’s muscles and other soft tissues; after all, muscles can grow throughout a dog’s life. Many mature dogs could even “bulk up” if put through an exercise regimen that included resistance training and proper nutrition.

But bones are different. They don’t grow at all during adulthood, and it is harder to envision the way by which they increase in size early in your pet’s life.

Rather than growing in a generalized manner that encompasses the entire bone, the long bones in a puppy’s legs grow from two distinct places called growth plates. Located at each end of the bones, growth plates are relatively thin cartilaginous regions in which new tissue is created.

The growth plates are somewhat flexible and soft during puppyhood when new tissue is being formed.

As the new tissue ages, it hardens and calcifies, eventually becoming bone. When the growth plates have stopped producing new tissue and become completely calcified, they are said to have “closed,” which means that they’ve stopped growing and the bone has reached its final size.

Growth plates are actually somewhat fragile and vulnerable to injury. So, it is important to prevent young puppies from engaging in excessive amounts of exercise, which may damage the growth plates. It’s also a bad idea to let pups jump great heights, such as onto or off of the couch.",Size and Breed-Related Puppy Growth Factors,"It turns out that small dogs stop growing sooner than large dogs do.

This makes sense, as large breeds grow much more between the day they’re born and the day they stop growing than small breeds do.

Consider, for example, that Chihuahua puppies are born weighing about 5 ounces, and they reach about 5 pounds or so at maturity. This means they increase their size by a factor of 15.

On the other hand, a Great Dane puppy weighs about 1 pound at birth and 100 pounds or more at maturity.

This means that they exhibit a 100-fold difference in size over the course of their lives (and 200-pound Great Danes experience twice this much growth!).

Because it takes time to convert food into new tissue, large breeds must continue to grow over a longer period of time than their smaller counterparts.

On average, small breeds typically stop growing by the time they reach 6 to 8 months of age, but giant breeds grow until they are 12 to 18 months old.

Larger breeds can end up costing quite a bit more, as a perfectly sized puppy bed won’t last too long with a young Newfoundland.

This is also something to keep in mind with selecting a crate for your pup – you may be better off opting for a larger-sized crate and using dividers to keep the space suitably-sized until your growing dog needs more room!",Other Factors that Alter Puppy Growth Rate,"Aside from your dog’s breed, there are a few other factors that can influence his growth rate and ultimate size. Two of the most important such factors include:

1. Genetic Differences

Every dog has a unique genetic code which can significantly influence the duration of his growth period, his build, and his adult size.

Some genetic traits are passed down from parent to puppy, but others are simply the result of the random variation that occurs during DNA recombination.

This means that puppies from large parents may themselves exhibit a slightly longer growth period and larger eventual size, but it is certainly not guaranteed. Large parents will occasionally produce small offspring and vice versa.

2. Nutrition

Puppies fed a poor diet may not be able to obtain all of the minerals and protein they require to grow into big, strapping canines.

Therefore, to maximize your pup’s potential (and generally keep him healthy), you’ll want to feed him a high-quality food specifically designed for puppies.

Such foods have higher protein content and are specifically formulated to provide puppies with the things their growing body’s need.

Note that if you have a large breed puppy, you’ll want to select a food designed specifically for them. Large puppies who grow too quickly can suffer from orthopedic problems later in life."
when do puppies stop teething,When Do Puppy’s Teeth Fall Out?,"Puppies get their baby teeth at a much younger age than human babies — as early as two-weeks old. As puppies grow, they explore their world with their mouths. When a puppy is about 3-to-4-months-old, puppy teeth begin to fall out to make room for 42 adult teeth. (That’s about 10 more teeth than people have.)

This process can be awfully painful for your pup — his gums will be sore. When teething occurs, you might notice the puppy drooling or see little spots of blood on his toys, although if you notice anything unusual, talk to your veterinarian since both symptoms could also be related to a more serious issue.

Once your puppy is 6-months-old, his baby teeth should have fallen out. According to AKC Chief Veterinary Officer Dr. Jerry Klein, “You may find puppy teeth on the floor, although the puppy is likely to swallow most of the teeth. If you find that some don’t fall out, be sure to tell your veterinarian. They may need to be removed by a veterinary professional.”

View a complete timeline of puppy teething.",How to Survive Puppy Teething,"The teething process is very uncomfortable for a puppy. Your job as a responsible owner is to provide something your pup can chew on to soothe sore gums and help make this process a little more comfortable. By doing so, you’ll be preventing the puppy from finding something on his own to chew, whether it’s your shoes, your couch, or your children’s toys.

The best objects to offer teething puppies depend on your dog’s size and level of activity. They include rubber teething toys that you can put in the freezer, such as a Kong, edible puppy teething rings, and flavored puppy chew toys.

Ask your veterinarian what the safest chew toys are for your puppy, and whatever you choose, always supervise chewing and playtime because nothing is safe for every dog. Dr. Klein suggests that allowing puppies and older dogs to chew anything very hard can cause damage to their teeth. Check the toys periodically to ensure they aren’t falling apart. Your puppy should not be able to chew chunks off or pull pieces of fiber or stuffing from them. Sticks can also be hazardous, although many puppies chew them.",How to Stop a Puppy From Nipping,"Puppies naturally nip at each other while playing and sometimes don’t realize how hard they’re able to bite down without hurting the other dog. If they bite too hard, another dog will make a loud yelp, warning the puppy, “Hey, that hurts!”

You can teach your puppy that biting hurts with a loud, high-pitched “OW” if he bites you. Then give him a treat or verbal praise for backing off. Beware that some puppies get even more worked up if you yell. In this case, turn around quietly or walk away, or gently put the pup in a crate for a few minutes to calm down.

Now is the time for them to learn how to moderate the force of a bite, called bite inhibition. Any adult dog might put their mouth on you or someone else, like your vet, if they’re in pain, but the outcome will be harmless if the dog has learned bite inhibition.

After teaching him that biting you is painful, let him know what he can bite or chew on. If he starts nibbling at your fingers or toes while you’re playing, offer him a toy instead. Keep toys where you can easily reach them so you can quickly offer an acceptable alternative when the puppy feels a need to chew.

If he continues to nip you, stop the play session so that he realizes that biting is not rewarded. You may also need to redirect that excessive puppy energy with outside playtime, a walk, or a training session. Never hit your dog or otherwise physically punish him. If your pet seems to be biting out of aggression (not during play), speak to a veterinarian or dog trainer about ways to deal with that behavior.",Problems with teething,"The most common developmental dental problems affecting puppies are:

• Malocclusion: This is the term used to describe a situation where the upper and lower teeth do not line up properly. Whilst solely cosmetic problems do not need to be addressed, misaligned teeth that cause damage to the gums or opposing teeth warrant intervention. • Retained deciduous teeth: This is when a permanent tooth erupts but the deciduous tooth also remains in place. If not removed, the retained teeth may alter the position of the permanent teeth, leading to malocclusion. • Extra teeth or missing teeth: Additional (supernumerary) teeth can lead to malocclusion and/or overcrowding, with an associated increased risk of periodontal disease.

Frequently puppies do not show any outward signs of the above abnormalities, so they are usually picked up when the mouth is examined during a routine health check. It is helpful to get your puppy used to his or her mouth being examined from an early age.",02 Feb When Do Puppies Stop Teething? [A Complete Guide],"Raising a puppy is no small feat. Training them to walk on a leash, potty training, and socialization are just a few of the responsibilities that come with raising your new companion. However, something that is commonly overlooked during this busy time is caring for their teeth during the teething process.

Puppies have razor-sharp teeth and they aren’t afraid to use them. We have all been victim to the scratches and wounds that are associated with a new pet. So, as dog parents, we all want to know “when will my puppy stop teething?”

Most puppies start teething at around 2 or 3 months of age and stop between 5 to 8 months, when all of their adult teeth have come in. This is a painful process for them, so make sure to have plenty of puppy-safe toys available. Once they have all 48 adult teeth, it’s crucial to continuously monitor and care for their dental health."
how long does it take a dog to have puppies,Signs That Your Dog Is Pregnant,"Even if it’s a surprise to you, there are signs that your dog may be pregnant before it’s confirmed by a veterinarian. For the first couple of weeks, everything will seem normal. Weight gain is common around week 3 or 4, along with morning sickness due to hormonal changes.

Your dog may seem tired and have less energy than normal. They may change their eating habits, either consuming more or less food depending on how they’re feeling. Around week 4, her mammary glands will begin to swell and may turn red to prepare for milk production.

If you suspect that your dog is pregnant, take her to the vet. They will be able to confirm your dog’s pregnancy, and she will need a physical examination to make sure she’s healthy. A checkup is suggested between 2 and 3 weeks of pregnancy. At 4 weeks pregnant, your dog will be able to have an ultrasound, and the growing puppies can be monitored as they grow. If your dog is examined by a vet after her 4th week of pregnancy, the vet will be able to feel the moving puppies inside of her. The puppies will be roughly the size of walnuts at this point and should only be felt externally by a trained veterinary professional. Trying to feel the puppies yourself may cause damage to them as they are developing.",Signs of Labor in Dogs,"When your dog has been pregnant for 58 days, she can go into labor at any time over the next 10 days. The length of pregnancy can also vary due to the size of the puppies, the number of puppies, and the breed of the mother dog. Signs that she is soon going into labor are:

Any change in behavior during this time should be noted and brought to the attention of your vet if you have any concerns.

Your dog may start to leak milk and you might be able to see the puppies actively moving inside of her. During weeks 7–9 of her pregnancy, one final vet visit will confirm her health, and you can get an X-ray of her abdomen so you will be able to see how many puppies she’s expecting. This will help you know what to watch for when she starts delivering them.",How Long Is a Dog in Labor?,"A dog’s labor is divided into three stages. Being aware of what happens during each will enable you to help the mother dog if she needs assistance and make sure the puppies are as healthy as possible.

Stage One Labor

The first stage of labor is the beginning of contractions and can last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours. The mother dog can display visible signs of discomfort during this stage. Pacing, restlessness, digging, and panting are often seen.

Stage Two Labor

This is where the bulk of the work takes place. Stage two of a dog’s labor includes frequent, strong contractions and the birth of the puppies. When these intense contractions lead to the birth of the first puppy, the rest should be born 45–60 minutes apart, following a 10–30-minute period of straining by the mother.

Sometimes, the mother takes a break from labor, and it’s not uncommon for her to not strain for up to 4 hours. If you’re expecting her to have more puppies and she’s taking a break, note how long it is before she’s contracting again. If you don’t notice any contractions after 4 hours, take her to the veterinarian. She may need assistance delivering the rest of the puppies. If she strains to deliver a puppy for more than 60 minutes, the same is true. She should be seen by a veterinarian immediately.

Stage Three Labor

This is the afterbirth stage. The mother dog will usually experience stages two and three with each puppy. The puppy is born, and then the afterbirth will come out 5–15 minutes later. This is the placenta and is usually a greenish-black mass of tissue. If several puppies are born in succession, the dog may deliver several placentas afterward. After a placenta is delivered, the mother returns to stage two if there are puppies left to deliver. There should be as many placentas delivered as there are puppies. If you are missing a placenta, your dog should see a vet. Undelivered placentas can make your dog sick.",How do you know if your dog is pregnant?,"Early signs of labor in dogs can be easy to miss. You may notice some behavioral changes in your pup, but external changes sometimes aren’t visible until the second trimester, said Dr. Richter. Around week four, hormone changes can cause morning sickness and sometimes a loss of appetite and energy. Also, her nipples will start to swell and become red due to milk production and her body getting ready to feed her puppies. By week five or six, you should start to notice weight gain. If you know that your dog isn’t pregnant, here are some other reasons behind their strange behavior.

“A trained veterinary professional can feel the puppies in the abdomen as early as four weeks, but you should not attempt this at home, as it could result in miscarriage,” says Dr. Richter. So, if you’re unsure if your dog is pregnant, it’s best to take her to a trained professional.",How do you know when your dog is in labor?,"When your dog is in labor, Dr. Richter says that she will start displaying the following symptoms:

• Vomiting

• Pooping/urinating more frequently

• Checking and/or licking hindquarters

• Shivering or panting

• Refusing to eat

• Nesting—looking for a place to make a safe and comfortable place to give birth

Also, keep an eye on her temperature. “Check her temperature regularly every 12 hours in the days leading up to birth—a dog’s internal temperature runs higher than ours, usually 100 to 101 degrees, but will drop to 98 degrees when she’s ready to give birth,” says Dr. Richter.

Typically, dogs will give birth at home, but if she is displaying signs of distress, has contractions for more than 10-15 minutes without having a puppy, or stops having contractions when there are still more puppies, take her to a vet to get medical attention immediately."
can puppies wear harnesses all the time,Should I Choose A Harness Over A Collar?,"Collars are usually a part of a dog’s appearance daily as it makes it easy for them to be identified.

However, as useful as these collars may be, they also come with their drawbacks as there have been instances where dogs damaged their necks in a big to free themselves from the collar.

It is therefore advisable that you remove the harness and collars off when it is time to sleep.

Generally speaking, it is better to make use of harnesses when you want to walk your dog.

However, a large number of people use both collars and harnesses; however, they use the harness for including a lead.

This allows your dog to enjoy comfort and control and it is even more so if your dog is the aggressive type as collars may cause injuries.",Tips For Selecting The Right Harness For Your Dog,"There are a few things you should know about choosing the right harness for your dog.

First and foremost, you should be aware that a well-fitting harness will not chafe, pull, or gap and it certainly should not irritate the dog.

Also, the right harness shouldn’t lead to rolls of skin gathering on the shoulder or neck of the dog. There shouldn’t be indentations on the place where the harness rested as well.

Dog owners with large-chested dogs such as Boxers, Bulldogs, and pit bulls may find it quite difficult to find the right harness that fits.

As far as finding the right harness, comfort should be the ultimate watchword. Usually, these Harnesses tend to be too tight on the shoulder or chest of the dog.

Hence, for you to ensure that it is neither too tight nor too loose, try and fit in two fingers behind the dog and the harness. In the case of a puppy make sure that you regularly check the fit to know when the dog outgrows it.

It should be noted that the majority of harnesses usually do not need a specialized type of training, however, some dogs need some time to adapt to a change to a harness.",What Are The Types Of Harnesses?,"There are quite a several harnesses available in the market today. It is also important to note that each one of these harnesses comes with its unique style and features. Here are some of the available options out there in the market.

Training Harness

This one comes with a leash at the front of the harness and it is expected to be in the middle of the dog’s chest.

Trainers are known to always go for front-clip harnesses to reduce the pulling on the leash by the dog.

This chest clip will go a long way in assisting the dog with the direction in which the dog goes and helps it redirect if the need arises.

Vest Harness

This type of harness is made from a mesh material that comes in different patterns and colors.

This style usually has some semblance to a vest and may even appear thicker than the other options out there.

Your dog may step into some while the others may be slipped over its head.

Back clip harness

This one is perhaps the easiest for your dog to get used to. They are designed for less aggressive dogs that have been trained not to drag the leash. They are also delicate for small dogs with rather delicate throats.

Step-in Harness

This is a design made so that your pet can step into the harness with great ease. It is easy to use as your dog only needs to step into the harness while you pull it up and get it clipped.

No-pull harness

Just like the front clip or training harness, the no-pull harness is created in such a way as dissuade your dog from pulling.

Also, the leash attachment ring will be located in the middle of the chest of your dog while the harness will help in adding pressure.

Some available styles help in tightening around the leg area of your dog.

Mobility harness

This is mostly used for older dogs or those suffering from one serious injury or the other. This full-body style is usually an aid for lifting the dog and not for regular use.",The pros of leaving on a dog’s harness,"Here are the pros of letting your dog wear a harness all the time, or at least most of the day:

• Harnesses give you something to grab on to pull your dog or puppy out of danger quickly or to stop your dog from running away• Dogs with very short necks, like Pugs, can’t wear a regular collar with ID tags around their necks, so a harness is a good substitute during the day in case the dog ever goes missing (though it’s always a good idea to get your dog microchipped and not just rely on tags for identification)• It’s quicker to get your puppy or dog outside for a potty break – just clip the leash onto the harness and you’re ready to go outside. This is especially handy if you live in an apartment or need to take your dog out every time for a potty break• If you have a puppy or dog that needs supervision for whatever reason, the harness gives you something to tie the dog to you and keep it nearby. This is much safer than using a neck collar, which can choke a dog or cause neck injuries if the dog pulls on it• Leaving a harness on a dog for a while can get your dog used to wearing a harness, which can make walks easier• Dogs tend to listen more and behave better with a harness on• Some dog owners claim that wearing a harness makes their anxious dog calmer, such as when there is a storm• If your dog ever runs away or into the road at night, a harness with reflective stripes will reflect cars’ lights, so drivers can see your dog and avoid hitting it• Older dogs or sick dogs that need help moving around or getting up and down can benefit from wearing a harness with handles on it – simply grip the handles and you can help your dog with what it needs• Service dogs and many working dogs are required to wear a harness all day while working, to help them get the job done",The cons of leaving on a dog’s harness,"There are cons or risks in letting your dog wear a harness all the time, such as:

• Harnesses can irritate a dog’s skin where it rubs a lot, especially if the harness is too small, too tight, worn for too long, or made of a rough material• If a harness is worn for too long and it rubs against the dog’s skin, the dog can lose hair in that area• A harness can rub against long fur and make the fur knotted or matted• Harnesses with a front strap across a dog’s chest can put pressure on the dog when it’s sitting down, making the harness very uncomfortable• Puppies and dogs with Pica have lots of time to chew on the harness and swallow pieces, which is a serious choking hazard• If a wet harness is left on a dog for too long, the dog could get a skin infection• A harness can hook on something your dog walks past and trap your dog• The harness can get dirty and start to smell if it isn’t removed and cleaned regularly. Here’s a great video showing you a very easy way to clean a dog’s harness:"
how to get puppy to stop biting,Make sure your puppy has plenty of interesting chew toys,"According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), during a puppy’s period of rapid development, which is from 2 to 10 months old, it’s important to give him appropriate toys. These toys can help with the discomfort of teething and with training while also providing mental stimulation. Be sure to choose a toy or bone best suited to your dog’s size and personality. The AKC offers a great roundup of the best toys for puppies.

With consistent positive-motivation training, most puppies will learn to play without biting and nipping humans. If despite your best efforts your dog still bites and you’re concerned that he’s getting aggressive, then it’s time to call in a behaviorist to design a training program for your dog. The sooner you work on the biting problem, the happier you and your dog will be as he transitions into adulthood.

Your puppy is going to mouth and that’s natural, but you want him to learn to be gentle. Puppies need to learn to control the strength of their jaws so that as adults if they ever bite out of fear or pain, they will have learned not to bite hard. A puppy first learns to be gentle from his mom and littermates. For instance, if a puppy bites too hard when playing, his sibling will yelp in protest or Mom will intervene to stop the roughhousing. Puppies have to learn these lessons all over again when playing with their human pack.

The ASPCA recommends drawing on the techniques used by littermates when teaching your dog to be gentle. So, if your puppy bites too hard on your skin, use a high-pitched “ouch” to interrupt the behavior. As soon as your puppy stops biting, give him praise and a treat. Some dogs may get more excited when you yelp. In this case, when your dog bites down too hard, just get up and walk away.",Use redirection to stop biting ,"Your ultimate goal is to train your puppy that teeth don’t belong on human skin, and redirection is a great way to do this. When your growing puppy starts to mouth or bite down on your hand, immediately redirect him to a tug toy or favorite chew bone. According to ASPCA experts, the goal is that your dog will “start to anticipate and look for a toy when he feels like mouthing or biting you.”

Some breeds such as border collies and Shetland sheepdogs have strong herding instincts and may nip at ankles to “herd” human family members as they move around the house. If you live with an ankle nipper, keep a favorite toy in your pocket, and when your dog attacks your ankles, stop walking and wave the toy in the air. Once your pup grabs the toy, praise him and move on. Keep repeating this exercise until you can walk around the house without being attacked by puppy teeth.",Encourage acceptable behavior,"Redirect your puppy’s chewing onto acceptable objects by offering her a small rawhide chew bone or other type of chew toy whenever you pet her. Rawhide and other bones should only be given when you can monitor your puppy to prevent choking.

This technique can be especially effective when children want to pet her. As you or the child reach out to scratch her behind the ears (not over the head) with one hand, offer the chew bone with the other. This will not only help your puppy learn that people and petting are wonderful, but will also keep her mouth busy while she’s being petted. Alternate which hand does the petting and which one has the chew bone. At first, you may need to pet or scratch your puppy for short periods of time, since the longer she’s petted, the more likely she is to get excited and start to nip.",Discourage unacceptable behavior,"You must also teach your puppy to be gentle with hands, and that nipping results in unpleasant consequences for her. Teach your puppy that nipping turns off any attention and social interaction with you. After a nip, look your puppy right in the eye, and yell, “Ouch!” as though you’ve been mortally wounded, then ignore her. Leave the room if you must, but ignore her until she’s calm, then try the chew bone and petting method again. It’s even better if you can coax your puppy into a sitting position using food. It may take many repetitions for her to understand what’s expected.

Nipping and mouthing hands can also be discouraged by loosely holding your puppy’s lower jaw between your thumb and forefinger after she’s taken your hand in her mouth. Don’t hurt her by squeezing too hard, just gently hang on so that wherever her mouth goes, your hand hangs on. This will quickly become tiresome and she’ll eventually pull away. After several seconds, release her jaw, but continue to offer her your hand. If she licks or ignores it, praise, pet and offer a tidbit. If she closes her mouth on your hand again, repeat the procedure.

A third alternative is to wear cotton gloves coated with a substance with an unpleasant taste such as Bitter Apple. In this way, your puppy will learn that “hands in mouth taste bad.” For this method to work, every time she nips your hand she must experience this bad taste. The possible disadvantage to this method is that your puppy may learn hands with gloves taste bad and those without gloves don’t.

Remember that any of these three methods will probably not be effective unless you work hard to teach your puppy the right behavior by offering her an acceptable chew toy."
when do puppies stop biting,When Does Biting Start?,"Being bitten by a tiny 8 week old puppy is surprisingly painful. It is also very upsetting. After all, we generally don’t bite our friends! Puppies start teething at 3-4 months old. Puppies do bite because they are teething, but they also bite in play. And biting tends to start in earnest once the puppy has settled into their new home, so around 9 weeks old.

With some exceptions, puppy biting will stop by the time your puppy has his full set of grown up teeth at 7 months. Fortunately, you can stop your puppy from biting long before they have cut all their adult teeth. And that is what this guide is about. So let’s find out how to stop a puppy from biting you and start enjoying them again.

You may even worry that your children might be at risk. Fortunately I can reassure you that this is not the case. While your puppy may frighten your children with his sharp teeth and growling. The way he is behaving now does not mean he will be a threat to their safety in the future.

Happily, studies have shown that behavior in small puppies is not predictive of the way that they will behave as adults!

Why Do Puppies Bite Children?

Some breeders will not sell puppies to homes where there are small children. This is because puppies often bite children and teenagers harder and more persistently than they bite grown-ups. It is normal for small puppies to make small children cry, but before you rush your puppy off to the local shelter, bear with me a moment, because I can help with that.

Children give off conflicting signals to the puppy. And because puppies are poor at interpreting children’s movements and vocalisations they respond inappropriately. Fortunately there are lots of ways to make it easier on yourself and on your kids. We’ll have a look at those in a moment.

In short, you need to be a little patient at this point, and it helps to know that this phase does pass quite quickly. And that it is completely normal for all puppies to bite a lot, and to bite children with particular enthusiasm!",My Puppy Is Growling At Me!,"When puppies play, they practice being fierce. They throw themselves into the whole play acting thing with huge enthusiasm. And they are brilliant at it.

Your puppy’s aim is to make himself sound hugely fierce and scary. It’s all part of the game. And the most important part of that game is to make as much noise as possible and to sound as angry as possible.

So, all puppies growl or snarl ferociously when they play, while they are biting, and sometimes when they are trying to entice their poor owners into yet another game. Your pup won’t just sound fierce, he’ll look fierce too. His little face will be all scrunched up, his lips drawn back, his teeth showing. It’s not surprising your kids have gone right off him!

Your puppy’s mother, and his brothers and sisters all understood this was a game and weren’t bothered by it. So he has no idea that he is frightening your children or that you are wondering if he is turning into a horrible aggressive and dangerous beast.

Please do be reassured, that however fierce your ten week old puppy sounds. It is just a game. He is truly just playing.",How long does it take for a puppy to stop biting?,"Most pet parents notice the biting starts ramping up shortly after puppy comes home to stay, usually around 9 weeks of age. Once his full set of adult teeth grow in, anywhere from 8-10 months, that drive and urge to bite will ease up.

When the new puppy biting is getting over the top, with chomping on your fingers, tugging the hem of your pants and pouncing on your feet with a nip, these are signs your puppy is just being a puppy. Take heart; puppy nips and bites are normal.

For most young dogs, curbing the biting is a process that requires a combination of teaching and allowing your dog to mature. That means puppies do outgrow the biting, but they need coaching from humans so they learn how to be gentle and not clamp down on the hand that feeds them.",Why do puppies bite in the first place?,"New puppy biting comes with the territory, especially if they’ve descended from a herding breed. Here are just a few reasons that drive this behavior:

Teething

Clamping down can soothe their achy gums.

Exploration

Licking, biting and gnawing are ways for puppies to experience all the tastes, textures and sensations of the new world. The mouth helps your puppy explore and make sense of the world. But it’s not fun when you are the target.

Playtime

Along with chasing, pouncing, growling and wrestling, biting is part of the game litters of puppies play with each other.

Learning

Puppies are bumbling creatures that are still figuring out their coordination and control.

Adjusting

After a growth spurt, it can take time for the pup to adjust and learn to function in his larger, more powerful body. At the same time, training and teaching can feel like an endless loop, where they re-learn the lesson that bites hurt others."
when do puppies lose their teeth,What to expect at the dental checkup,"The vet will check your puppy for:

Crooked teeth – this can be caused by two teeth coming in at one spot, or if a baby tooth has not fallen out when the adult tooth is emerging. This may be evident during their vaccination checkups

Jaw misalignment – for some breeds with short muzzles, a slight underbite is normal However, if your puppy is showing signs of a strong underbite or overbite, vet intervention may be required to correct chewing and eating issues in the future. These conditions are best treated early

Bad breath – this is not normal in dogs and may indicate that your puppy has a low grade infection

Broken or cracked teeth – if a tooth has broken below the gum line and the nerve is exposed, your puppy will be in discomfort and may develop an infection

Bleeding and swollen gums – this may be a sign of teething

Tartar build up – while tartar build up is uncommon in puppies, it occasionally does happen. Implement a dental routine while your puppy is young to avoid dental diseases in the future

Book an Appointment",How Should You Monitor the Teething Process?,"There’s not much you can do to speed up the teething process. It is best to let puppy teeth fall out on their own because you could accidentally damage the root if you try to pull it out. Sometimes, a puppy’s baby teeth get stuck and won’t come out, leaving the adult teeth with nowhere to go. In this case, you need to intervene to reduce the risk of infection and periodontal disease. Take your puppy to a professional to remove the stuck baby tooth properly.

Certain breeds are more prone to having stuck baby teethe than others. Yorkshire terriers, in particular, are notorious for needing professional help while teething. You should know if your puppy’s breed is known for needing help during the teething process.

In general, the best thing you can do to help your puppy with the teething process is to provide it with plenty of toys to chew on. Chewing helps puppies deal with teething, and if you don’t provide them with appropriate items, they’ll turn to shoes, pillows, and furniture for chewing. Expect this behavior to continue until a puppy is at least six months old.",The Life Cycle of Puppy Teeth,"For newborn pups, their teeth will typically start to grow in around two weeks old. You’ll be able to tell that your little pup is teething if they are drooling more or chewing on more things. These baby teeth can be very sharp and unpleasant. Since puppies drink their mom’s milk and then move to kibble, it may cause you to wonder why puppies have such sharp teeth in the first place. One common thought is that domestication has not fully impacted their teeth. Historically, wild dogs had to have razor-sharp teeth in order to tear into their first taste of meat. It’s also thought that sharp teeth will help with the weaning process, as well as teach bite inhibition.

Puppies start to lose their baby teeth at around four months old as their adult teeth begin to come in. Sometimes you may find that a baby tooth will be stubborn and will remain in their mouth… if this happens, you should consult your local veterinarian as the tooth might need to be extracted.",Discomfort During the Teething Period,"Just like humans, it’s common for your furry friend to experience a certain level of discomfort while teething. They may whine more than usual or chew on more of your beloved personal items. It’s important to do what you can to help ease their discomfort during this period; try to find quality chew toys specifically designed for teething pups.

Although it may be easy to get frustrated from time to time when you find that they’ve chewed up your favorite sneakers – again – try to be mindful and aware of the changes they are experiencing. Before you know it, your puppy will lose all of their baby teeth and your shoes will be safe once again!

Always seek the advice of your veterinarian with any questions you may have regarding the medical condition of your pet. If you think your pet has a medical emergency, call or visit your veterinarian or your local veterinary emergency hospital immediately.",When to Worry,"Most of the time teething is goes smoothly, but if you notice your dog’s upper jaw jutting far out beyond the lower, your pup may have an abnormal bite that needs correction. If you notice your dog having trouble chewing, get him to a vet or dentist so they can help. If you notice your dog is in pain and they don’t seem to be losing their baby teeth on schedule, it might be time to get things checked out. Sometimes teeth can occlude and cause infection or jaw problems. While your dog is teething, dental cleaning will be key! Make sure you get a dental cleaning in by the end of the first year.

Your pup will get through this time with just a little help from you and patience on both your parts. Just watch out for your shoes as he teethes!"
when do puppy teeth fall out,How do you know if your puppy’s teeth falling out is normal?,"It’s totally normal and expected for all of your puppy’s baby teeth to fall out and to be replaced with a new set of adult teeth. While the aforementioned growth time frame is to be expected, growth can vary from puppy to puppy. The only time your dog losing teeth is a problem is if they’re losing their permanent adult teeth.

Another thing to look out for is a permanent tooth coming up in a space still occupied by a baby tooth. This is called a retained deciduous tooth, and is common in small breed dogs. The most common retained deciduous teeth are the canine teeth. If this abnormality occurs, you should schedule an appointment with your veterinarian to have the baby tooth removed, as it will cause damage to the adult tooth if it is left in your dog’s mouth.",Puppy teeth and dental disease,"The crowding of baby teeth and permanent adult teeth at the same time can lead to periodontal disease, which is why it’s important to check in with a veterinarian if you notice any retained deciduous teeth.

It is not recommended for pet parents to pull their puppy’s baby teeth out, as pulling teeth can break the roots, leaving behind parts that might lead to infection.

In order to prevent dental disease, make sure to brush your dog’s teeth regularly with a dog toothbrush and toothpaste, along with following these other dental care tips.

In the event of an infection or periodontal disease, having the right pet insurance can help you pay for the best care possible. That’s why Pumpkin’s puppy insurance plans cover exam fees, X-rays, and treatment for dental disease. Take a step towards protecting your pup’s pearly whites and get a quote today!",How To Care For Puppy Teeth,"Your puppy’s baby teeth don’t need that much care, since they won’t have them for long before they get replaced by an adult set. You will want to keep their gums healthy, though, and you should also start to train your puppy about tooth brushing from a young age so that it is routine once they are an adult dog.

From the time that they are about 12 weeks old, you can start giving attention to their mouth so that they can get used to it.

Start by gently massaging their gums with clean fingers so that they become comfortable with being touched there. Give them lots of rewards like hugs and snuggles when they handle this well.

Once they are comfortable with that intrusion, you can introduce the toothbrush and toothpaste. Start with a dental brush that fits on your finger to repeat the sensation they already know, and then graduate to other products.

While their teeth are changing, they might suffer quite a bit of discomfort in their mouths and some dental toys can help. Rubbing their gums on a hard or slightly abrasive surface can provide considerable relief. Plus, if you don’t provide chew toys they will probably just chew whatever is around.

If they are in particular pain, a cooling sensation can also help. It can be a good idea to put their favorite teething toy in the fridge or freezer for a while before giving it to them.

Did you miss canine dental health month?",Caring For Your Dog’s Adult Teeth,"Once your puppy’s adult teeth come through, you will probably want to step up your dental care regime. If something happens to these teeth, they won’t be getting any more.

While the process might seem tedious, it is not challenging to look after your dog’s teeth.

Just like with your teeth, a healthy mouth starts with regular brushing. While your dog might not tolerate having its teeth brushed daily, an absolute minimum of once a week is required though vets recommend three times a week.

In between, you can use dental chew toys that are designed to keep your dog’s teeth clean through abrasion to prevent cavities. You can find the best dental chews on Chewy here.

In addition to this regular cleaning that you do yourself, you should also book regular professional cleanings with your dentist or groomer. This can double as a check-up that can alert you to problems early.

Aside from this, it is important to feed your dog appropriately. Just like with humans, what you eat can degrade your teeth and you want to avoid too much of anything that is too gritty or has excess sugar. Moreover, good nutrition will make them and their teeth more resilient.

True or false: a dog’s mouth is cleaner than a human’s.",Which Dog Breeds Are Most Prone To Dental Problems?,"As with most health concerns, some breeds of dogs are more prone to dental issues than others. Here are some of the dog breeds with the worst teeth!

Collies

Collies often have a pronounced overbite which can result in uneven wear and gum damage as a result of tooth impact.

Pugs

Dogs like pugs, which have squashed faces, are more likely to develop gum disease than other dogs. Also, they often have upper and lower teeth that don’t align properly and can cause pain when they close in on one another. Their small faces also mean overcrowded mouths, so food is more likely to get trapped and start to cause decay.

Yorkies

Yorkies and other toy breeds often end up with snaggle teeth and retain baby teeth as their adult teeth grow in. This can be a problem because they form food traps that cause faster decay.

It is often recommended to have these baby teeth removed, but that also can be a problem if their adult teeth aren’t fully formed, as it can inhibit their chewing ability.

Chihuahuas

Chihuahuas are another small dog breed that just doesn’t have enough room in their mouths for all those teeth. This results in plaque build-up, which inevitably leads to gum disease.

Dachshunds

Sausage dogs don’t just have an elongated body, they also have an elongated snout. This can lead to periodontal pockets.

This is where bacteria gets trapped between the gum and the tooth, causing gum tissue to break away from the tooth and allow decay on the surface of the teeth. Infections can quickly make their way down to the roots of the teeth."
why do puppies eat their poop,Poop Eating Is Normal for Dogs and Puppies,"For some species, such as rabbits, eating fecal droppings is a totally normal way of obtaining key nutrients. In fact, if you prevent rabbits from doing this, they will develop health problems, and young ones will fail to thrive. Fortunately, dogs do not need to get nutrition this way. It is, however, a normal, natural behavior at some canine life stages. Mother dogs will lick their puppies to urge them to eliminate, and clean up their feces by eating it, for about the first three weeks after birth. Puppies will also naturally engage in this behavior, eating both their own poop (autocoprophagia), poop from other dogs (allocoprophagia), as well as poop from cats and other animals. Some dogs find horse manure and goose droppings particularly appealing. Eating their own poop is harmless, but consuming poop from other animals may cause health problems if the stool is contaminated with parasites, viruses, or toxins. In most cases, this behavior will fade before the puppy is about nine months old.",Attention seeking…,"Both puppies and adult dogs may eat faeces for attention, as it often provokes a dramatic response when done in front of their owners.  Although it may be difficult, try not to over-react.

Accompany your dog to toilet, on the lead if necessary. When they have finished encourage them to move away from the poo – distract them away with a tasty treat or toy. Do not worry about picking up the poo immediately as you do not want to build up any desire for your dog to “get to it before you do”. If there is someone else with you, ask them to pick up the poo once your dog is distracted, or if you are at home or alone on a walk with your dog, scatter some treats on the floor or hide a toy for them to find whilst you go back and pick it up.

Similarly, older dogs can suddenly start eating faeces due to stress.  Consider the household and routine; could anything have changed to upset your dog?  Try and add in some extra walks and one-on-one time.",How to stop this behaviour… ,"There are many suggested treatments available online to stop your dog eating faeces; both commercial products and home remedies.  All are added to food, and are supposed to work by altering the taste of the dog’s stool.  Effectiveness tends to vary dog to dog – they are certainly worth trying but not all products are successful in all dogs.

Ultimately, whatever the cause eating faeces is a nasty habit that needs to be broken.  The most effective way of going about this is to physically prevent the dog eating faeces; primarily being prompt about picking up any mess as soon as it’s produced. As above, if you dog is eating another animals’ faeces, use the distraction technique to encourage them away for a tasty treat or play with a toy. Eventually they should forget the behaviour.  If your dog has a very persistent problem, it may be worth consulting a veterinary behaviourist.",Why Dogs Eat Poop,"Identify the underlying reasons as to why puppies eat their poop to determine the best course of action to stop it and break the habit. Most of the remedies involve dog training or diet changes. Regardless of why a dog eats poop, there is usually a very logical how to stop dogs eating poop.

The Term for Poop Eating: Coprophagia

Coprophagia or coprophagy is the term used to describe the act of eating feces. It isn't a condition based on underlying medical issues, although that may be the case. Often, coprophagia starts as a behavioral trait that isn’t deterred through early training. It is always wise for dog owners to discuss any behavioral issues with a veterinarian to rule out medical issues.",The Term for Poop Eating: Coprophagia,"Coprophagia or coprophagy is the term used to describe the act of eating feces.

Many puppies begin to eat stool when in the litter. In fact, it is a natural instinct for canine moms to eat her puppies' stool in order to help keep the den clean and to prevent predators from smelling the feces and hunting her pups. Puppies will mimic mom and will also eat stool out of boredom or hunger when mom isn’t around to provide food. Mother dogs continue to eat their puppies' stool until they are weaned and more active and independent.

This is considered a behavioral issue that most dogs will outgrow as they are weaned and begin to eat solid dog food. However, some puppies continue to eat stool as a result of poor dog owner practices of not cleaning up quickly, leaving curious noses and mouths to investigate and eat the feces."
what time is the puppy bowl 2021,What is Puppy Bowl?,"As the name hints at, animal shelter puppies are pitted against each other in a twist on the Super Bowl.

Rules are quite relaxed, but the little dogs are given football-shaped toys to carry to their end zones for touchdowns in a model arena named GEICO Stadium in New York City.

The number of puppies change from season to season, while they are given time to rest every 30 minutes - as timeouts are called when water bowls need refilling or if there is any ""ruff"" play between participants.

Unlike the human game, there can be more than one touchdown scored at once, while a team touchdown is when two puppies carry the same toy over the line.

And also different to a normal NFL game, things tend to get a bit messy, with the dogs often relieving themselves on the field of play and getting sexually active.

Thankfully this is edited out of the final showing, but you wouldn't want to be the ones having to clean it up.",When is the Puppy Bowl 2022?,"Puppy Bowl XVIII airs on February 13 with a pre-show featuring furry hosts at 1 p.m. ET.

what shots do puppies need,Puppy Vaccinations Cost,"How much vaccinations for your puppy will cost depends on several factors. Where you live is one: Veterinarians in crowded and expensive urban areas will charge more than a rural vet in a small town. In other words, there are significant differences in price. But no matter what the range in costs, some vaccines, such as the “core vaccines,” and for rabies, are necessary.

• The average cost can average around $75—100. These will include the core vaccines, which are administered in a series of three: at 6-, 12-, and 16 weeks old.

• The core vaccines include the DHLPP (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, and parainfluenza). Your pup will also need a rabies vaccination, which is usually around $15—20. (Some clinics include the cost of the rabies vaccination.)

• Often animal shelters charge less for vaccines — approximately $20 — or are even free. If you acquired your dog from a shelter, he would most likely have been vaccinated, up until the age when you got him.

The initial puppy vaccination costs during the first year are higher than during adulthood.",Vaccinations for Adult Dogs: Boosters and Titers,"There is a difference of opinion about having your adult dog vaccinated every year. Some vets believe too many vaccinations in adult dogs pose health risks. But others disagree, saying that yearly vaccinations will prevent dangerous diseases such as distemper. Talk with your vet to determine what kind of vaccination protocol works for you and your dog.

Many dog owners opt for titer tests before they administer annual vaccinations. Titer tests measure a dog’s immunity levels, and this can determine which, if any, vaccinations are necessary. One key exception to this is rabies: a titer test is not an option when it comes to the rabies vaccine. This vaccination is required by law across the United States. Your vet can tell you the schedule for your particular state.

And it’s all worth it. For your effort and care your puppy will lavish you with lifelong love in return. This critical first year of her life is a fun and exciting time for both of you. As she grows physically, the wonderful bond between you will grow, too.",Canine Distemper,"A severe and contagious disease caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), and nervous systems of dogs, raccoons, skunks, and other animals, distemper spreads through airborne exposure (through sneezing or coughing) from an infected animal. The virus can also be transmitted by shared food and water bowls and equipment. It causes discharges from the eyes and nose, fever, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, twitching, paralysis, and, often, death. This disease used to be known as “hard pad” because it causes the footpad to thicken and harden.

There is no cure for distemper. Treatment consists of supportive care and efforts to prevent secondary infections, control symptoms of vomiting, seizures and more. If the animal survives the symptoms, it is hoped that the dog’s immune system will have a chance to fight it off. Infected dogs can shed the virus for months.",When Your Puppy is 12-15 Weeks,"Once your puppy starts growing a little bit bigger than a little bit stronger they can handle stronger vaccines, and will likely need them, too.

The following vaccines are recommended for puppies ages 12 to 15 weeks:

Corona Virus

The Corona virus is highly contagious and attacks the intestinal tract. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. There are no drugs that can kill the virus, however, vets can offer symptom relief.

Bordetella

Bordetella is another cause of kennel cough. It is a bacterial infection that is highly resistant to antibiotics, making it very difficult to treat. The infection is transmitted through air and direct contact.

Canine Influenza H3N2 & H3N8

H3N2 and H3N8 are two strains of dog flu that are highly contagious and cause serious respiratory distress. Puppies should be vaccinated against both strains to be fully protected.

Rabies Virus 1st Year

The rabies vaccine is required by law in most areas. Rabies attacks the central nervous system, causing symptoms of headache, anxiety, excessive drooling, hallucinations, and fear of water. Rabies is most often transmitted from an animal who already has the virus. This is a deadly disease that is easily transmitted to humans.",Do Puppy Vaccinations Have Side Effects?,"The short answer is yes, but only sometimes.

It’s the same idea as when people get the flu shot. For some, the influenza vaccine can make them feel drowsy or even a little bit sick, but for others, the vaccine has no side effects. This is because your immune system is unique and customized to you, and while similar to the general public, it may react differently to potential irritants.

Fun Tip: this is why people experience allergies to different products.

Always ask your vet about potential side effects for each vaccine, as they will vary. It’s important to keep a close eye on your puppy for the first 24 hours after any new vaccine, as they may have a reaction to it.

Call your vet immediately if you notice severe or uncommon side effects."
can puppies have peanut butter,How Much Peanut Butter Can Dogs Eat?,"Peanut butter is rich in natural fats and protein, but too much of a good thing can lead to obesity and other health complications like pancreatitis. There are two things you can do to figure out how much peanut butter to feed your dog on a regular basis. The first and most reliable option is to call your veterinarian and ask his or her advice. This is especially important for owners of dogs with conditions such as diabetes or with food sensitivity issues.

The second option is the 10 percent rule. In general, treats should not make up more than 10 percent of your dog’s diet. Simply measure how much food your dog gets daily, and remember that it might be a good idea to alternate between peanut butter and healthier treats, such as dog friendly fruits or vegetables.",Health Alert: Xylitol,"Most peanut butter is safe, but some can be deadly. Recently, some peanut butter manufacturers switched to using the sweetener xylitol. Xylitol is a sugar substitute often found in sugar-free products like chewing gum, toothpaste, breath mints, chewable vitamins and baked goods. It is safe for people, but toxic to dogs.

Xylitol consumption causes a rapid release of insulin in dogs, which results in an equally rapid and profound decrease in blood sugar levels. and can be life threatening if left untreated. This condition, scientifically known as hypoglycemia, can occur as quickly as 10-to-60 minutes after eating xylitol.

Xylitol poisoning is easy to avoid. All owners need to do is check the label of the peanut butter and any other product they plan on feeding to their dogs for xylitol, and keep xylitol products out of their dogs’ reach. If you think your dog has eaten xylitol, contact your veterinarian immediately, and keep an eye out for symptoms of xylitol poisoning, such as weakness, collapse, staggering, lack of coordination, and seizures.

Don’t keep your pup in suspense any longer. Yes, dogs can eat peanut butter as long as it is fed in moderation and does not contain xylitol, so get out that pet-safe peanut butter jar and share the good news.",Peanut butter should not be fed to puppies every day,"You can’t use peanut butter as a daily treat, especially when your dog is very young. Puppies have sensitive digestive systems and slowly build up tolerances to different foods. The protein and the fat in this treat aren’t great in large amounts.

This is also true for older dogs that would lick a whole jar clean if they could. It is also important to remember that too much peanut butter could also contribute to obesity and diseases of the pancreas.

So, make note of how much your pet gets and ensure that other family members do the same. It is important that you stay on top of this to provide consistency and to avoid health issues. For example, you may have a pup that loves to beg for food and has a tendency towards overeating. This could lead to overconsumption through lots of small amounts.

Kids that don’t know any better could offer a spoon of peanut butter if they aren’t informed of the consequences. Also, make sure to tell your partner if you give the dog a peanut butter treat so that they know not to do the same that day. Keep portions small for senior dogs too",Runner Up Peanut Butters for Dogs,"The following are commonly bought natural peanut butters and would also make great peanut butters for dogs. However, they didn’t make our top picks due to either availability, price,  flavor, or texture.

Note: Manufacturers may add, change, or remove ingredients without warning. Always read the label before buying peanut butter you intend to feed your dog.","Peanuts, Peanut Butter and Dogs","Raw peanuts contain an assortment of vitamins and minerals, but they are also loaded with protein and fat. Dogs are, evolutionarily speaking, quite recently descended from wolves. The vast majority of a wolves’ energy comes from fat and protein. Therefore, your dog should not be negatively affected by a small amount of extra fat in his diet.

But, moderation is important. Too much fat long-term can lead to obesity and pancreatitis, which is an inflammatory condition that affects the pancreas.

In the short-term, too much fat in your dog’s diet can cause diarrhea or vomiting. And, if that happens, your dog won’t absorb any of the nutrients in the peanuts or their regular food. So, dogs can eat peanuts in moderation. But not all of the types that we eat are okay for dogs."
how much do puppies sleep,Tips for Helping Puppy Get Daytime Sleep,"• Leave your puppy undisturbed. It is hard to resist cuddling him and letting him fall asleep in your lap, but you don’t want him to be dependent on you to fall asleep. Household members, including children, should learn to leave your puppy alone while he is sleeping. But be sure to keep an eye on him because when he wakes up, he’ll need to be taken outside.

• Show your puppy where to sleep. If he seems drowsy, encourage him to nap in his safe place: a crate, a dog bed, or a quiet place in the house where he can nap undisturbed.  It may take time for him to get the idea, but eventually he’ll recognize that spot as the place for sleep.

• Follow a schedule. Plan his day so that active time is followed by quiet time for sleep. He’ll most likely be ready for a nap after playtime or a walk. Your puppy may nap every hour or so, sleeping from 30 minutes to as long as two hours. All of this sleep is perfectly normal.

• Recognize overtired behavior. No matter how much fun you’re having, don’t let him get overtired. Too much stimulation and exhaustion can lead to unfortunate behavior. Guide him to his crate or sleeping place and encourage him to wind down.",Tips for Helping Your Puppy Sleep at Night,"• Make the crate inviting. Don’t buy an expensive dog bed for a new pup, because he’s likely to chew it up. Line the bottom of the crate with a soft, felted, inexpensive blanket or two. Beware of wool blankets or mats that can be chewed apart into long strings that cause choking. If you can, bring home a soft toy or baby blanket that smells like the pup’s mom and keep that in the crate. Many owners place the puppy’s crate in their bedroom, so he can feel that his family is close by.

• Establish a bedtime routine. By giving him a routine right from the start, you’ll teach him that nighttime is for sleeping, and you both will get a better night’s sleep. Restrict the pup’s intake of food and water for several hours before bedtime. Play with him, cuddle him, and take him outside to relieve himself.

• Keep his sleep area quiet and dim. If you watch TV in bed, keep the volume down and the light low. You may even want to use blackout shades if the room gets early morning light. The quiet and dark will be his cue that it’s time for sleep. If your crate is the wire type, you can put a cover over top of it to make it darker and more den-like.

• Don’t give in at bedtime. First make sure your puppy has had a chance to go to the bathroom and has plenty of physical and mental exercise during the day. Teach him to love getting into his crate by rewarding him with a treat. While he’s learning the routine, be prepared for some whining, barking, or howling before he settles in for the night.

• Be prepared for interruptions. Just like human babies, puppies sometimes are not yet ready to sleep through the night. Your puppy may need a potty break during the night. If he’s sleeping in a crate in your bedroom, you’ll be able to respond if he needs to go out. Calmly carry him outside, praise him quietly when he goes, and put him right back in the crate for sleeping.",Your Puppy’s Sleep Schedule,"Puppies thrive on routine and structure. Along with a feeding routine and house training routine, a sleep schedule will help you and your puppy adjust to living together. This sample schedule should help you on your way to establishing a good routine, for canine and human family members.

Morning Puppy Schedule

• In the morning when the puppy wakes up, quickly take him outside to relieve himself..

• Feed him breakfast.

• Puppies usually need to relieve themselves after eating, so give him another potty break.

• Spend 30-60 minutes of playing with him, socializing, and taking a walk.

• Nap time. He may sleep from 30 minutes to two hours.

• Give him another potty break as soon as he wakes up.

• Feed him lunch.

Afternoon Puppy Schedule

• After lunch, give him a potty break.

• For up to one hour, play with him and allow him to explore.

• It’s nap time again.

• Take him outside for a bathroom break when he wakes up.

• And then it’s playtime again.

• Chances are pretty good he’ll settle in for a nap after he plays.

• Potty break.

Evening Puppy Schedule

• Feed your pup dinner before you sit down, or give him a stuffed Kong to work on in the crate while you eat.

• After dinner, take a walk.

• Let him spend time playing and interacting with family members.

• Give him  a quick bathroom trip before bed, and then settling him down in his crate for nighttime sleep.

Don’t let the idea of a schedule overwhelm you. It may seem like a lot of work, but you’ll be rewarded with a happy, well-adjusted dog and you will come to enjoy the routine, too. This is a wonderful time for developing the bond and love that will last a lifetime.",Why is my dog so sleepy?,"Sleep is extremely important for dogs and humans alike. Without the proper amount of rest, it is extremely challenging to perform at the best of our abilities. Your pup is learning and growing every second of the day. Their sleep provides them the chance to recharge their batteries to be ready to do it all again tomorrow.

Sleep is important for retaining knowledge and forming memories. If you are proactive about teaching your dog after it is fully rested, it will learn faster, and you will develop a better rapport. It’s not easy to plan every moment around your dog — and you won’t be able to. That said, time with and away from you is important for healthy development. It can be challenging to learn how to live in a balanced way as a pet owner. It becomes easier the more you practice and continue to educate yourself on what works with your unique pet.",The sleeping habits of a healthy puppy,"Your new puppy is a real ball of energy. He can sometimes seem like a never-ending source of energetic excitement, but then it happens: Your pup gets all tuckered out and can sleep for what seems like hours, even in the middle of the day. What’s a healthy sleep schedule for a growing pup anyway?

• Your growing baby dog needs sleep. A lot of it. Puppies sleep a lot during the daytime and typically require about 6 to 10 hours in the evening, too. Your pup will likely pass out quite hard after getting a lot of activity in. A walk around the block, some kisses, and play might be all it takes. Then your pup will lay wherever he is and quickly be in dreamland.

• Daytime napping is perfectly healthy for your new pup. They will know when and how much sleep they need. Thirty minutes to two hours is a typical time span for a healthy pup nap. Puppies, like babies, will often fall asleep right where they are. Do not disturb or wake up your sleeping puppy — just let him rest.

• When your puppy is very young, he might want to go for a walk in the middle of the night. By 16 weeks or so, it should be easy for your puppy to sleep soundly through the night for about 6 to 10 hours. Sleep is very important for the healthy development of your pup. It might take some getting used to for everyone in your new family, but in time, you will get the bedtime thing down easily."
how many puppies can a dog have,Typical Dog Litter Sizes,"A typical litter size tends to vary from 1–12 puppies, with 5 to 6 pups being average across all dogs. However, large breeds can have up to 15 pups. It is a wide range and depends on the species, size, health, and your dog’s pregnancy history.

Giant breeds will often have larger puppies’ litter, while miniature dogs’ breeds will have smaller ones, maybe only a couple. That is due to the smaller size of the mini dog breeds. Your dog may also have fewer pups if it is its first time to give birth but will probably have more puppies every pregnancy after that.

In addition, your dog must remain healthy since it plays a significant role in how many pups she will have. A dog’s proper nutrition helps her produce more puppies that will develop and survive the pregnancy process.",How Many Puppies Can a Dog Have?,"Toward the end of your dog’s pregnancy, your vet will likely be able to palpate the mom’s tummy or take an x-ray to determine an “exact” number of puppies in her belly (although it can be easy to miss one of the puppies, so you’ll never know for sure until the little wigglers start coming out).

This is the only way you’ll be able to know how many puppies your dog may have. And to be honest, that’s probably what you care about anyway.

But there is some value in knowing a ballpark number to expect, even if your pregnant dog mom isn’t far enough along for your vet to determine how many little cuties she’s carrying.

A pretty exhaustive study of the topic was published in 2011. The researchers analyzed over 10,000 litters representing 224 breeds and found that the mean (average) litter size in this group was 5.4.

However, there’s a fair amount of variation at play. Miniature breeds typically produced litters of 3.5 puppies, while large breeds typically produced 7.1 puppies per litter.",What’s the Largest Litter Ever Recorded?,"In 2004, a Neapolitan mastiff named Tia became the mother of the largest litter ever documented, when she delivered 24 puppies via Caesarian section.

This is obviously quite the anomaly, as most dogs produce much smaller litters than this. In fact, Neapolitan mastiff litters typically number between 6 and 10 puppies.

A few other notable cases involving huge litters include:

• A Springer Spaniel gave birth to 14 puppies in 2009.• An Irish setter gave birth to 15 puppies in 2017 (on Mother’s Day, no less).• A white German shepherd named Mosha gave birth to 17 puppies in 2015.• In 2016, a Maremma sheepdog gave birth to a litter of 17 – which set the California state record for litter size.• A bullmastiff produced a litter of 23 puppies in 2014.• In 2014, a 3-year-old Great Dane gave birth to a litter of 19 puppies.",How Many Litters Can a Dog Produce in a Year?,"Some females can produce multiple litters within a 12-month period. It just depends on the dog’s natural cycle, body condition and the desires of the breeder. A handful of canines will cycle three or four times a year, but most dogs only have two cycles per year, spaced about six months apart.

But, breeding a female twice in the same year is frowned upon by many breeders. Doing so is very hard on the mom’s body, and many believe that it will result in a decline in the total number of puppies produced by a dog over her lifetime. Accordingly, many will allow their dog to produce a litter, and then give her a breather during her next heat cycle. This essentially means that they’ll produce one litter per year.

However, other breeders see no reason to avoid breeding dogs in heat, as long as they are healthy and in good physical condition.

In fact, breeders of this mindset often argue that because fertility decreases with age and most dogs will be six months older with every heat cycle, you can produce more puppies over the course of a female’s life by breeding in back-to-back heat cycles during the prime reproductive years of a dog’s life.",Find Out How Many Puppies in a Litter,"The best thing you can do to prepare is to schedule an appointment with your vet.

The perfect time for this is after the 45th day of her pregnancy.

Your vet can take an x-ray of her belly and tell you how many puppies to look for during delivery.

During this appointment, your vet can also go over the birthing process.

They can help prepare you for what to expect and how to help your dog.

They will also tell you what not to do, as well as how to know if your dog may need professional help.

Have a backup plan or know where your local emergency animal hospital is located.

Know their phone number or have it saved in your phone.

They will also go over nutrition for your dog.

At this stage in their pregnancy, they should be transitioned to a food high in calories and nutrients.

A high performance food could work, but puppy food is perfectly fine as well.

You will need it soon anyways, for when the puppies are weaned to dry food weeks later."
how to house train a puppy,Limit Space,"The greatest mistake pet parents make is giving too much space too soon. Just as a child earns more and more freedom as she matures, so too should dogs earn more space. In other words, don’t give your dog the keys to the entire house right away. If you already have, consider reducing privileges to one room or even a smaller area and gradually expand the area allowed as the dog proves responsible. Limit access by closing doors or using barriers such as baby gates or exercise pens. Use a harness and leash to keep your dog next to you so you can supervise his activity. When he’s unsupervised, limit access with a crate or gated dog area. Ideally, this dog-specific space will have nonporous hard flooring rather than carpeting where elimination smells are more likely to cling.",Confinement,"In order to successfully house train a puppy, itâs important to use some type of confinement such as a crate, an exercise pen, or a safe room thatâs gated in.

An appropriately-sized wire crate or exercise pen can really help you house train your pup. You can purchase a wire crate that has a divider you can move as the puppy grows.

A wire crate or plastic kennel should be large enough for your puppy to stand up in, turn around in, and lie down in.

You donât want it to be too large or the puppy may go to the bathroom in one area and sleep in another. Crates work because puppies inherently want to keep themselves and their sleeping area clean.

If you decide to use a crate, you need to be sure that the puppy is taken out frequently when he needs to potty or heâll have unavoidable accidents in his crate.

If you canât get him out to potty when needed, you may need to recruit a trusted friend or family member to get him to his potty area.  You can also hire a dog walker to help you potty him and to meet his other needs while youâre at work.

You can use an exercise pen to confine your puppy. Or you can confine him to a small room such as a bathroom or kitchen with a baby gate.

If you use a room, be sure that thereâs nothing that he can reach thatâs unsafe. This includes anything that he can ingest such as towels or cleaning products.

The problem with using an exercise pen or safe room is that the puppy might tend to have accidents in one part and play and sleep in another part.

So if you use these methods of confinement, youâll need to have someone take your puppy to his potty place often so that heâll understand where he should potty.

Another alternative is to have an inside potty area as discussed below. This can really help house train dogs who live in apartments or condos.",âGo Pottyâ Phrase Cue,"In house training a puppy, itâs important to take them to the same area in the beginning. Their scent will be there and they get used to going in the same area and on the same footing.

When you get to his potty area, use a phrase such as âgo pottyâ before he goes. It will actually become a cue for him to go and will encourage him to go faster.

I currently have five dogs, rescued golden retriever Riley, shelties Murphy and Gracie, Lhasa apso Ralphie, and Rescued Aussie mix Millie.

Iâve trained all of them to go to the bathroom very quickly after I tell them to âgo potty.â

Of course, praise is part of their reinforcement. And I gave them small treats when I was first teaching them where to go and to potty quickly.

THE MORE YOU KNOW: At the guide dog school, they teach their puppies the cue “get busy” when it’s time to potty. At one of the service dog schools, they teach the cue “better go now”.  It doesn’t matter what cue you use, just choose one that you think will work best for your puppy.",Accidents Happen,"Most puppies will have an occasional accident. If you see him having a housetraining indiscretion, donât harshly correct him.

You can use an interrupter by calmly saying âeh-eh,â then take him to his potty area and praise and reward after he goes.

If he has an accident that you donât see, just clean it up with an odor neutralizer such as Rocco & Roxie Stain and Odor Remover.

Always have your clean-up supplies ready because there will probably be a few accidents even when youâre diligent.

Have poop bags, enzymatic cleaner, and paper towels ready. You may also want to have a special trash can and liner ready for any fecal matter or paper towels that have been used for clean-up.

You shouldnât punish him. He wonât understand after the fact. Just watch him more diligently next time.",Make the Space Smaller,"For a puppy, a home is a very large, confusing space. In his mind, inside his new big home, there are many different eating, sleeping, playing and bathroom places. “It’s difficult for him to understand that, even though our house is so vast, he is not allowed to potty anywhere within it,” Trott says.

This is why one of the easiest and most successful ways to potty-train a puppy is to “make the house smaller” for your pup—if he doesn’t have a complete run of the house, he won’t be able to randomly go off into another room when he needs to pee. “If you can, for example, have him in only your living room, kept in by baby gates. He will be much less likely to potty in this smaller space,” Trott says.

As he gets older and used to holding it or letting you know when it’s time to go, you can expand his access to the house one extra room at a time."
how much should i feed my puppy,How Often To Feed A Puppy,"So now that you know how much to feed your puppy, you might be wondering, “How many times a day should a puppy eat?” Setting a routine for your puppy’s feeding schedule is critical so he can learn when to expect his food.

• 4-12 Weeks: Young puppies need three or more feedings per day to adequately meet their nutritional needs. So, according to the feeding guide that comes with their food or the chart above, divide that by three or more and give the food to them throughout the day.• 3-12 Months: As your puppy gets older, you can reduce the number of feedings to twice daily. Their energy level should reduce; thus, they don’t need as much food throughout the day.• 12+ Months: Most adult dogs eat two meals per day. You’ll want to divide their food requirement by two.

Puppy Feeding Schedule

A typical feeding schedule for puppies is 7am, noon, and 5pm. If you decide to do more than three feedings, you can adjust your schedule for puppy eating times as needed. Make sure to keep that last feeding around the 5 o’clock mark. That way, your pup has ample time to digest the food and eliminate it one last time before bedtime.

Keep To The Schedule To Avoid Overeating

We know that it can be tempting to leave food out all day for your puppy to munch on, especially if you have a busy schedule. However, free-choice feeding encourages overeating, which can cause your pup to gain too much weight. Portion control is key to making sure your puppy eats the proper amount for his size and age.",How Much Food Should I Feed My Puppy?,"These amounts are for every 24 hours.

When you compare a puppy food to an adult dog food, you will notice some differences. Guidelines established by the AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) require more of almost every nutrient for puppy food versus adult food. The exception are some vitamins, which can easily be overdosed.

One of these differences include the minimum protein requirement, which is 22.5 percent on a dry matter basis for puppies and 18 percent at minimum for adult dogs. One percent calcium with 0.8 percent phosphorus is listed for puppies, while adult dogs need 0.6 of calcium and 0.5 of phosphorus. Puppy foods will also contain more fat and often have DHA added for brain development.

Try these vet-recommended puppy foods:",Puppy Feeding Schedule,"Don’t fall into the trap of always leaving food down: This can increase your puppy’s chances of overeating. (Although your dog should always have access to fresh water up to an hour or two before bedtime.) Feed your puppy the specified quantities set by your vet and your puppy’s food label at mealtimes, so you know exactly when your puppy last ate and how much.

Most puppies do best with three meals a day until 6 months of age, then switching over to two meals a day. For toy- and small-breed dogs, four meals a day until 6 months, then three meals a day may be best. Ask your vet about a specific feeding schedule to ensure you're meeting your dog's unique needs.

Learn more about how often you should be feeding your puppy here.",How to Wean Puppies,"As for a 5-week-old puppy feeding schedule, this is around when most people will start to wean their puppies.

• For what to feed puppies who are weaning, use a commercially made, balanced food. Kibble should be softened with water or broth to a soupy texture, or you can add a little extra water to wet puppy food.

• To get the puppies interested, dip your finger into the mush and then let them lick it. Puppies quickly learn to lap up the food.

• Make sure each pup is getting their fair share. Separate dog bowls given under supervision is ideal.

• While feeding puppies your weaning mix, there is no standard set of directions for how much a puppy should eat. Continue to weigh your puppies daily. You want pups that are growing but not overweight.

• If the puppies are still nursing a bit, figure on offering them three or four meals a day as a puppy feeding schedule. Toy and small breed pups may need some extra snacks, as they are susceptible to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

• Nutritional weaning is complete when the puppies are eating only puppy food and no longer nursing at all. When litters and moms are kept together, pups are usually eating only puppy food at around 8 weeks of age."
how much should a goldendoodle puppy eat,How Much Should I Feed My Dog?,"How much to feed a dog is based on their age, size, weight and of course their overall health. Every dog is unique and one size does not fit all. The simplest place to start at is by asking your vet what your dog’s ideal adult weight range is and calculating their needs based on that.

If you adopted your pup from a reputable breeder, they should be able to tell you the weight of your dog’s same-sex parent. This can be a great tool to determine how big your dog should ideally be when reaching adulthood.

Furthermore, the amount of food your dog needs also depends on how much they exercise (i.e. how much energy they spend and thus require). If you have a rather lazy-natured dog, they probably need a little bit less food. If your dog never sits still, they might need a bit more.

Also, keep in mind that pregnant or nursing dogs have different needs while taking care of their little ones. Same goes for dogs recovering from surgery or illness. On the other hand, senior dogs usually have lower energy requirements and thus need a bit less food to avoid obesity.

Dog Feeding Chart

There are many great dog feeding charts out there that can be helpful in determining your dog’s needs. Here is a great recommended daily feeding chart that shows roughly how many calories your dog should eat daily.",How Often Should I Feed My Dog?,"We all know dogs love to eat…all the time. Looking into those cute – although often manipulating – eyes and trying to say no to them can be tough. But keep in mind that you’re doing this for of your pup’s health.

Feeding your dog twice a day should be perfectly enough. Some owners even feed their dogs once a day, which can also be acceptable (discuss this with your vet first!). Keep in mind that this only applies to fully grown adult dogs. We’ll cover puppies a bit later on in this article.

Should I Free Feed My Dog?

For some dogs, the free-choice or free-feeding method works great, especially for pregnant and nursing dogs.

If you have an active pup, you can calculate the exact amount of food they need daily and leave out that amount for the whole day. They might enjoy grazing throughout the day and won’t overeat in one go.

However, for many dogs, the timed feeding method works best. It’s especially not recommended to leave limitless food out if you have more than one dog.",How Much to Feed a Puppy,"Now that we’ve covered how much adult dogs should eat, let’s have a look at puppies. So how much should I feed my puppy? As they are growing and developing, puppies do need more frequent meals and more energy.

You’ll probably be able to bring your pup home when they’re around two months old. Before that, they should be able to feed on their mother’s milk as much as they want. Typically, the breeder will have already introduced puppy food before you take yours home. If not, you can start introducing puppy food and scheduled meal times at around 4 to 12 weeks of age. (But we absolutely recommend you discuss this with your vet and follow the exact requirements for your pup.)

Moreover, do not feed your puppy adult dog food until they’ve reached their adult size. Puppies need to grow and develop and thus they need more nutrients and calories. Your vet will be able to recommend high quality puppy food that takes into account all of your pup’s needs.

Puppy Feeding Chart by Age

Below is a good, generalized puppy feeding guide and puppy feeding chart by age.

Here’s another useful chart that shows the caloric requirements for puppies based on how much they’ll weigh once grown up:",Goldendoodle Health Issues,"With any crossbreed, a puppy’s health in adulthood will be directly influenced by that of his parents.

So when you go to view a Goldendoodle puppy, always ask the breeder to show the pup’s mom and dad.

You should also ask to see hip score documentation and veterinary certification so that you can check that neither of your puppy’s parents has a history of serious health problems.

There are quite a few health issues that are commonly suffered by adult Goldendoodles, including:

• Hip and elbow dysplasia

• Subaortic stenosis

• Eye problems, including cataracts

• Ear infections

• Luxating patellas

• Addison’s disease

• Hypothyroidism

Goldendoodles can also be prone to stomach upset, so be sure to choose a diet that’s specially formulated for digestive system health.

In particular, avoid feeding your puppy dog food that contains artificial colors, preservatives, or flavorings.",Best Puppy Food for Goldendoodles,"When choosing the best puppy food for a Goldendoodle, you should look for a food that has plenty of protein and fat that is derived from good-quality sources.

Check the list of ingredients on the side of the product packaging, and look for a food that contains two or three meat proteins.

Protein can take the form of fish or meat meal, but it must be shown in the first couple of ingredients on the list.

That means that the food is not bulked out with fillers and cereals, and that meat is one of the primary ingredients.

Many dog food brands add peas, lentils, and vegetables to their foods as protein sources.

Although that’s okay, you really want a Goldendoodle puppy food that contains more meat protein than plant protein.

Fiber

Your Goldendoodle puppy will need plenty of fiber to keep his digestive system working efficiently.

Although some fiber is contained in meat meal and meat, rice and vegetables also add bulk to the dog’s diet.

Don’t buy dog foods that contain a high percentage of cereal, thinking that it will add fiber to your pup’s diet.

Cereals are typically used to pad out the food and have no real nutritional value.

Fat

Now, although you might eat a low-fat diet, your Goldendoodle puppy certainly shouldn’t!

Fat is an extremely important element of a dog’s diet, as it provides much of their energy requirements.

Goldendoodles have a gorgeous, thick curly coat, and a diet that contains adequate fat is essential to keep your pet’s crowning glory in tiptop condition.

Also, omega-3 fatty acids help to support your Goldendoodle puppy’s brain and eye development, helping to ward off health problems such as cataracts.

When choosing a Goldendoodle puppy food, look for ingredients including chicken fat, flaxseed, and canola oil, all of which are good sources of fat."
how long do puppies teeth,How To Survive Puppy Teething,"When puppies are going through the teething phase, they bite everything insight as a way to soothe the discomfort. So, if your pup attempts to chew on something inappropriate, redirect his chewing attention to something else. Here are a few good options:

KONG Puppy Teething Stick – This toy is made with KONGs durable rubber and designed to soothe your growing puppy’s baby teeth and gums. Along with giving your pup something to gnaw on, this thick rubber stick features strategically placed grooves that help clean teeth.

Once your dog begins gnawing on the bitter-coated spot, he should be deterred by the taste.",How Many Teeth Does a Dog Have?,"A puppy grows 28 baby teeth. Those include 12 incisors, 4 canines and 12 premolars, according to the Dogster article, What Age Do Puppies Lose Their Teeth?. In comparison to us humans, a puppy doesn’t have his baby teeth for very long. A month after he finishes growing them, your puppy starts losing his baby teeth.

Adult dogs have 42 teeth. Specifically, they have 12 incisors, four canines, 16 premolars and 10 molars. They don’t grow in all at once (check out some specifics on teething below), but all of your dog’s adult teeth are in by the time he’s 6 months old. These are the teeth he’ll have for the rest of his life.

You might be wondering where your puppy’s teeth end up during all this. Turns out, you might not ever find your puppy’s lost teeth. Oftentimes, a puppy swallows his own baby teeth. That’s kind of gross, but it’s nothing to be concerned about.

What you do need to be concerned about is if a baby tooth doesn’t fall out. According to Dr. Everett Mobley of Kennett Veterinary Clinic in Kennett, Missouri, sometimes an adult tooth comes in right behind a baby tooth, and two teeth are meant for one spot. “This is most common with the canine teeth, the fangs, and it’s not good,” Dr. Mobley writes in his blog, Your Pet’s Best Friend. “If you see permanent teeth coming in while the baby teeth are still there, it’s important to have those baby teeth extracted.”",When Do Dogs Stop Teething?,"According to the article, What Age Do Puppies Lose Their Teeth?, this is a general timeline of when your puppy’s teeth come in.

• 3 to 5 weeks: Your puppy’s four canines emerge.

• 5 to 6 weeks: Your puppy’s premolars come in.

By 8 weeks of age, the full set of baby teeth have come in.

Adult Teeth

• Weeks 12 to 16, the adult incisors start coming in. The canines come in around this time, too.

• Weeks 16 to 20: Your dog’s premolars start coming in.

• Weeks 16 to 24: Your dog’s molars come in.

By 5 to 6 months of age, all of your puppy’s adult teeth should have come in.",Why Are Puppy Teeth So Sharp?,"Let’s go back to the velociraptor description. Sharp puppy teeth are a throwback to the earliest dogs. As an ancient puppy transitioned from milk to solid food, he needed sharp teeth to tear into the meat his mom brought him.

Sharp teeth also have a social function, in that they teach your puppy how to interact with other dogs. This is called ‘bite inhibition,’ and puppies must learn that biting another puppy too hard while playing is bad. That’s according to this Dogster article, How to Train Your Puppy to Have a Soft Mouth. “Your pup will learn that he will get more play time if he is gentle with his friends,” author Cindy Bruckart writes. “Older dogs might give a scarier correction for obnoxious puppy biting, and most pups will want to avoid that in the future.”

Unfortunately, it’s often hard for our puppies to learn not to bite us hard, and it can take a while to get that lesson into their cute little heads.",Talk to a Vet for More Information About Puppy Teething Symptoms,"Remember that puppies go through the teething process twice in their lives, as opposed to human babies who only do it once. Newborn puppies have no teeth and start getting them at around 2 weeks of age. At around 8 weeks of age, puppies lose their baby teeth and grow their adult teeth, which is usually the stage that causes the most problems for puppy owners.

It takes anywhere from four to six months for puppies to completely finish teething. This timeline varies depending on the puppy.

On occasion puppies will not lost all their baby teeth and they will have what is called “retained deciduous” teeth. It’s important to know that your veterinarian examine your puppies mouth during their puppy visits to confirm appropriate tooth loss, as retained teeth can cause problems in the mouth later in life.

If you have any questions, or are unsure if your puppy is experiencing teething symptoms, then it’s important to call and speak with a veterinarian. While this is not a dangerous process for your puppy to go through, your vet will be able to offer additional advice on how to help your puppy go through this stage of life."
how often to feed a puppy,How Much Should Puppies Eat?,"A fresh meal service like Ollie helps change your feeding approach as your dog changes ages from puppy to adult so you don’t have to worry about portions during different life stages.

Since puppies are growing rapidly, they need more food than adult dogs. Puppy nutrition is crucial for developing a foundation for future growth, as well as their bone and organ development. Puppies must have a specific amount of calcium in their diet, otherwise, they can develop metabolic bone disease or orthopedic conditions like early-onset arthritis. Toy-breed puppies, in particular, are prone to hypoglycemia.

Puppies need small, frequent feedings. For the first few months of a puppy’s life, they will need small meals of food throughout the day as they transition from their mother’s milk to solid food. Starting around four months, puppies can begin eating about three times a day, and after that, puppies will quickly graduate to twice-a-day feedings.

Feeding them three or four times per day makes it easier for puppies to digest and help keep energy levels consistent. However, it’s important to not overfeed them, since overweight puppies are more likely to become overweight adult dogs.

Toy-breed puppies will need 4 to 6 meals per day for the first three months of their lives. Medium-breed puppies will require three meals per day, and large-breed puppies typically need 3 to 4 meals per day. Though the breed is an important consideration, metabolism and energy levels can vary by up to 30 percent. Therefore, you’ll need to proportion meals accordingly.

Even though puppies grow quickly, it’s important to keep caloric intake and food amount consistent from four to twelve months of age. Puppies use fewer calories for growth as they become older. This comprehensive puppy feeding chart has vet-recommended guidelines on how much and how often to feed your puppy.",How Much Should Adult Dogs Eat?,"Don’t let your dog trick you into more mealtimes with adorable puppy dog eyes. Most dogs only require two meals a day, but if you catch your dog begging, an occasional healthy treat can help.

The trick is to make sure you’re not feeding your dog more than is recommended. Food labels can be misleading or confusing. Generic feeding charts may over-calculate how much to feed a dog, or use outdated information.

To determine how much food to feed your dog, you should start by knowing your dog’s estimated adult weight. Most large breed dogs will weigh between 50 to 150 pounds, while small breeds weigh under 20 pounds. Knowing the weight of your dog’s same-sex parent can also be an excellent guide.

From there, you can use the estimated weight to determine how many calories dogs need per day.",Why Ollie?,"Feeding dogs a diet made with natural, real ingredients can do wonders for their overall well-being—it can promote heart health, increase energy level, make their coat shinier, their breath smell better, improve eyesight and even impact poop.

How Old Is Your Puppy?

The age of your cuddly puppy makes a big difference in how often they eat. Newborn puppies should nurse as frequently as mom will allow. However, if their mother’s milk is not available or is insufficient, you’ll need to help them get enough nutrition by bottle-feeding them frequently.

Once the puppy is approximately 4 to 6 weeks of age, they can begin transitioning to puppy food. To help them transition, it’s helpful to offer small amounts of puppy food that’s been softened with a puppy milk replacer (or warm water) four times per day.

By 6 to 8 weeks of age, most puppies do well eating 4 meals of puppy food a day (maybe 5 for the tiniest of pups). By 12 to 16 weeks of age, puppies can usually eat three times a day.

How Big Is Your Puppy?

A dog’s size also influences how often a puppy should eat. Toy breeds, such as Chihuahuas, are prone to developing low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) when they don’t eat often enough.These small breed puppies may need to be fed four to six times a day until they are roughly 16 weeks of age to prevent hypoglycemia.

On the other paw, some giant and large breed puppies—such as Great Danes—are prone to bloating. For that reason, veterinarians frequently recommend feeding several smaller meals a day to help prevent bloat in large breed puppies.",How Much to Feed a Puppy,"Feeding your pup measured amounts of food at each meal is the best way to keep track of their appetite and ensure that they aren’t getting too much or too little of those noms.

Of course, the type of pet food being fed and a puppy’s unique physiology and activity play a big role as well.

Puppy food labels have charts for how often and how much you should feed that particular food to your puppy. You can also refer to this handy puppy feeding chart below. Divide the total amount by the number of meals your puppy eats per day to find out how much to give at each meal.

Puppy Feeding Chart

Monitor your pup’s body condition closely so you can fine-tune their diet. For instance, if your puppy is getting a bit chunky, then cut back a smidge. Too thin? Add a little extra to each meal. The science isn’t exact because every puppy is very unique!

The puppy feeding guide in this article can also give you an idea of the number of calories your puppy should be taking in each day, which you can then use to calculate the amount of dry dog food or wet dog food ( or both!) that you offer at each meal.

If feeding your pup measured meals isn’t possible, we get it. As an alternative, try putting out an ample supply of food at each meal and then pick up what’s left after 10 to 15 minutes. Some puppies do well with this type of timed feeding, but you need to watch their weight carefully to make sure they aren’t getting too skinny or too fat."
do puppies sleep a lot,The science of puppy sleep,"Sleep is crucial to your puppy’s development. At this age, they are growing incredibly quickly, experiencing new sounds, sights and smells and playing constantly during their waking hours. They need sleep to help them recoup their energy, process the new things they are seeing and learning, and more.

Whilst the many benefits and purposes of sleep are still being researched, it’s believed that sleep:

• Provides energy to brain and body• Contributes to a healthy immune system• Balances appetites• Releases hormones, including hormones essential to growth and development

All this is as true for you and it is for your puppy and just as human children need more sleep than their parents, so do puppies need more than adult dogs.",Creating sleep schedules for your puppy,"The best way to ensure your puppy gets the right amount of sleep is to stick to clear sleep routines, especially in their first few months at home with you. Follow our step-by-step guide to create a healthy routine:

• Designate an area for your puppy that is comfortable and calm. Make sure the whole family, especially children, understand that your puppy should not be disturbed in this area. A dog crate with a comfy bed inside and blankets draped over the top to stop light getting in is ideal.• Familiarise your puppy with this area. Give them treats whilst there to make sure they have positive associations with it. • Have set times for waking up in the morning and going to bed at night, and avoid letting your puppy sleep too much in the hours before bedtime.• Allocate time for naps throughout the day – such as after a vigorous play session or a walk. Your puppy will begin to expect the quiet time and gladly bed down.• As your puppy gets older, adjust your routine to suit them. They’ll have more energy and need less sleep, so naps won’t be needed so regularly – they’ll also become good at taking themselves off to their quiet place when they are tired without you having to step in at all.",Is it possible for a puppy to sleep too much?,"The short answer is no. You will see variations on the amount of sleep according to age and breed, and activity, but young puppies need about 18 to 20 hours of sleep a day.  (Adult dogs typically sleep about 14 hours a day, as a comparison.)

That’s a lot of sleep! But when you stop and think about it, consider how much is going on – she’s literally growing a little bit every day, she’s learning new things every day, and she’s playing with her toys and with you. It’s exhausting! And just like all baby animals—including infants and small children—growing puppies need a lot of naps.

It takes a lot of energy to grow and to learn new things, and you want to be sure that along with exercise and play time, she’s getting plenty of downtime to sleep and rest.",Create a sleep routine,"As with all babies, your new puppy with thrive on routine. You’ll notice that after a meal he may want to sleep for a while, or after a walk or game of fetch. It’s helpful to you and your puppy to get on a schedule for:

• mealtimes

• play times

• nap times

For example: after a rousing game of fetch, or chase or keep away, it’s time for a snack and a trip outside to potty, then a nap.

Crate training can be very helpful with routines, as the quiet of a crate and the comfort of his own space will let him know it’s time for sleep.

The bulk of your puppy’s daily 18-20 hours of sleep will, of course, be during the night, when we are sleeping, so it’s a good idea to not let her nap too long in the few hours before the time you normally retire to bed yourself. You don’t want to wind her up too much, nor overtire her, but be sure she’s not been sleeping so much that she’s wide awake and ready to PLAY when it’s time to go to bed for the evening.",Am I worrying over nothing?,"What if you go to wake him after a nap and he’s still sleeping? (Pro tip: let him sleep.) Or, what if you have a puppy like my last puppy, and she sleeps so deeply she doesn’t even wake up when her bladder is full and instead wets the bed. That can’t be right…can it? While it may not be typical for puppies to sleep that deeply, it’s not unheard of.

Probably the best indicator of normal behavior is how he behaves when he’s awake. Is he active and bright? Interested in his surroundings and engaged with you and other family members (including other canine or feline family members)? Is he a little bit mischievous, grabbing the sneaker you left by the door and running off with it? Yep, you have a normal, healthy puppy.

But if during normal wake periods you notice your puppy seems lethargic and sluggish, not wanting to move much, or otherwise dull and disinterested in his surroundings, this could be cause for concern. If he’s recently had a vaccine booster, he may be extra tired for about 24 hours afterward,  but if that’s not the case, and he seems physically depressed during normal waking hours, call your veterinarian immediately.

Otherwise, as the old saying goes, let sleeping dogs lie, and enjoy the quiet time until your wee fanged tornado wakes up to start all over again. And then enjoy that time, too!"

Well, there’s no need to imagine if you’re a puppy owner.

Owning puppies can be an amazing yet tiring experience. Especially when you’ve been playing with your puppy all day and when it comes to their bedtime, your puppy won’t sleep at night.

Many questions may be arising in your mind, is it the right time for them to sleep, are they having separation anxiety, or do they need to be tired out more? (Check out our guide to bringing home a new puppy)

Well, we don’t know you or your dog, so we can’t tell you precisely what the answer is. But, what we can do is share with you cool and useful information about your puppy sleeping.",Where should my puppy sleep at night time?,"No doubt, getting a puppy is an exciting time, but you have to plan for the arrival of your new little furry friend. Often, a common question that arises for puppy owners is, where is the ideal place for a puppy to sleep?

Well, the truth is, when your puppy is new to your home, then you should make sure for the first few weeks it sleeps in a crate near to your bed. This way, the puppy will not have separation anxiety and will feel comforted knowing it’s next to you.

Please do not bring your puppy to sleep with you in bed, as they will develop a bad habit of doing this from an early age.

After the 3 week period is over, then you should ideally move your puppies crate or a bed into a corner with no draft. Ideally, a kitchen, because then your puppy needs to go to the bathroom, you will be able to clean up their mess.

Moreover, if you already own some dogs, you may wish to put your puppies bed near them, so they become acquainted with the scent and become comforted by their presence.",How do I train my puppy to sleep in a crate?,"As mentioned above, it’s going to be much easier to teach your puppy to sleep in a crate. The crate training method is used to train so many puppy behaviors; it’s that effective. To get your puppy familiarised with having its bed, i.e., a crate, you will want to put it in a quiet corner.

Inside the crate, you will want to cover it with bedding, so it feels comfortable to sleep in. You won’t want to purchase expensive bedding as your puppy might chew it up, so inexpensive blankets will do.

Similarly, add a cover on top of the crate. When your puppy feels drowsy, i.e., sleepy, slowly put them in the crate, shut the door, and place the cover over. The closed towel will signify to them it’s time for bed.",How Do Sleep Routines Differ Between Dogs and Humans?,"We love our Zzz as much as our dog best friends do. But dogs spend a lot more time sleeping than us.

So do puppies sleep a lot?

Depending on their age, dogs spend around 12–14 hours a day sleeping. When they’re little, sleep time takes them even longer — up to 22 hours a day.

While the human sleep cycle lasts around an hour and a half, a doggy can only sleep 45 minutes at a time and would go through two sleep cycles in this time.

Another difference between human and dog sleeping routines is that dogs are polyphasic sleepers. This means that they get their sleeping hours by napping throughout the day, while humans are monophasic and only sleep at night.

Do Puppies Sleep Through the Night?

Puppies up to two months old need to go to the toilet pretty often. They can’t control their bladders or bowels, so they need frequent potty breaks even at night.

Older puppies, which already have some control over their toilet needs, can go through the night without a problem.

How Many Hours a Day Do Puppies Sleep?

Depending on their age, puppies sleep 14–22 hours a day. Younger puppies need more sleep as their bodies are growing rapidly. They’re still developing their sight, hearing, and smell, and they need to learn to walk and run.

Older pups would sleep around 14 hours a day, depending on their activity level. Large breed puppies tend to sleep more, as they become tired more quickly.",How Long Do Puppies Sleep?,"The time a puppy would spend sleeping largely depends on its age. But its activity level, diet, and breed also have an impact.

How Much Do 8 Week Old Puppies Sleep?

During the critical age of 8–16 weeks, puppies pick up every rewarded behavior and start learning how to be a real dog (instead of a cuddly plush).

In this stage, a pup would sleep 18–20 hours a day. It might sound a lot, yet small puppies don’t have enough energy to keep them up all day. They would wake up, eat, go to the toilet, play for 15–20 minutes and sleep again.

But when they’re awake, they’ll make sure to turn your house around, especially if you haven’t learned how to potty train your puppy.

How Much Do Puppies Sleep at 16 Weeks?

Around the fourth month, puppies usually start sleeping at night without the need to eliminate every few hours. But they’ll still need to spend most of their day sleeping.

How Much Do Puppies Sleep at 6 Months?

At half a year, puppies still need plenty of sleep. 16–18 hours a day is an average amount of sleep for such a young dog. During these months, the puppy is learning all the time and growing rapidly.

They’re also full of energy, but that doesn’t last long. Puppies would run, play, and jump around in one moment, and in the next, they’ll be snoring peacefully in their beds."

what is a puppy mill,Differences in breeding conditions[edit],"The Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club both state that responsible breeders should raise their animals with the intent to produce healthy dogs and to ensure that all animals are provided responsible homes and socialization. However, there is no way to enforce these wishes or records being kept to prove this is the case.[7][8] The socialization period in a puppy occurs between the ages of 4 weeks and up to 14 weeks of age.[9] This period is crucial for adult development as almost all adult abilities are learned during this stage. With puppy mills essentially skipping the process of socialization, the result is often social problems when the puppy matures to adulthood.[9]

Females in puppy mills are sometimes bred every time they are in heat, regardless of whether they have physically recovered from the last litter. Once a breeding female can no longer be bred, whether from pure exhaustion or from age, the female is usually killed.[10] Puppies are also often weaned from their mothers well before the recommended 8–⁠10 weeks of age.[11]",History[edit],"According to Chanis Major V. publications, puppy mills originated in the post-World War II era. Midwestern farmers looking for an alternative crop reacted to a growing demand for puppies, resulting in the development of the first commercial puppy business. As the industry grew, both small and large retail outlets began to sell puppies through pet departments. At around the same time, the first pet store chains were born.[24]

Puppy mill dogs are usually housed in a small, wire cages similar to rabbit hutches and chicken coops.[25] In addition, veterinary care for these puppies was often overlooked because of an inability to pay. As a result, organizations such as the Humane Society of the United States began to investigate breeding kennels, leading to the passage of the Animal Welfare Act of August 24, 1966.[24][26]",Prevalence[edit],"United States[edit]

According to the Humane Society of the United States, only about 3,000 of the 10,000 puppy mills in the United States are closely monitored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.[citation needed] This presents the possibility of significant noncompliance with federal law by owners and operators of mill operations. Puppy mills do not only affect the dogs that live in and come from them; purchases from pet stores and breeders lessen the number of adoptions from shelters, where three to four million dogs are euthanized every year.[citation needed]

A high concentration of both puppy mills and breeders has been reported in the states of Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri.[27]

Pennsylvania, and in particular, Lancaster County, has been labeled the ""Puppy Mill Capital of the East"" due to its high volume of puppy mills.[28][29][30]

Missouri has been labeled the ""Puppy Mill Capital of the U.S."" by animal welfare and consumer protection groups.[31][32][33]  A study by the Better Business Bureau concluded that the southwest corner of Missouri is the hub of the nation's puppy mill industry, and termed it the ""national hot spot of the puppy industry.""[33] The state of Missouri has around 1,600 puppy mills as of 2018[34]

Australia[edit]

Dog breeding is regulated by individual Australian states. There is no available data on the prevalence of puppy farms.[35]

In 2010 the RSPCA Australia identified 12 puppy farms in the state of Queensland and estimated a similar prevalence in other Australian states.[36]",What is a puppy mill?,"Puppy mills are large-scale, commercial dog breeding facilities. They have one goal: to make money breeding and selling as many dogs as possible.

Dogs in puppy mills are kept in inhumane conditions, often caged for their entire lives and bred over and over again without regard for proper care or careful breeding. “Puppy mill” conditions can include:

• Small cages with wire floors that hurt dog feet and legs

• Cages stacked on top of one another without ample ventilation

• Poor sanitary practices, leading to illness and parasites

• Forced breeding of female dogs with little time for recovery between litters

• Puppies separated from their mother at too young an age, which can impact health and behavior for years to come

Puppy mills sell puppies through pet stores, or directly to consumers through the Internet and classified ads. The vast majority of puppies in pet stores come from puppy mills!",What’s so bad about puppy mills?,"People will often say, “I bought my puppy from a pet store, but she’s a wonderful pet.” While this may be true, unfortunately, the problem of puppy mills extends far beyond the individual dog.

Because of poor breeding and care conditions, puppy mill puppies will end up in pet stores and new homes with parasites, kennel cough, pneumonia, and other infirmities. Also, they may have behavioral problems, fear, and anxiety from being separated from their mothers and littermates too soon.

In addition to harming individual dogs, puppy mills are also harmful to the breeds they reproduce. Because puppy mills are focused on making money, they often breed dogs with no regard for genetic quality. That leads to puppies prone to congenital and hereditary conditions, like heart disease and respiratory disorders.

Puppy mills also take homes away from animals in shelters, rescue groups, and reputable breeders. Although an individual puppy mill puppy can grow into a happy, beloved family member, the fact is, puppy mills are harmful to a great many dogs. Puppy mills place profit over animal welfare."
how to discipline a puppy,It is OK to punish your puppy?,"The short answer is: no. It is not OK to punish your puppy.

The most important thing during a puppy’s first months of life is to teach him that you are his friend and protector and that you are reliable, predictable and fun.

Your puppy most likely has no idea what you are punishing him for if you discipline him. It is impossible for him to comprehend what went wrong when you use yelling, time-outs or even smacking as a consequence for his behaviors.

The puppy won’t associate the discipline with something he did – rather he will associate the discipline with you as an owner and learn to not trust you. This is the very last thing you want!

The argument often comes up that dogs also – at times harshly – correct each other and that it is therefore ok to discipline your dog. I disagree with that strongly.

Dogs have very intricate social structures and they learn to treat other like they are being treated. If your puppy has for example experienced that one dog at the dog park can be bold and rude, he might be stand-offish around him and snap when this dog comes too close. If your new puppy on the other hand learned that a dog is always friendly and sweet, he himself will be much more gentle and docile around that nice dog.

The same goes for the relationship between a puppy and his owner. If the owner chooses to be harsh and heavy-handed, the puppy will remember this and adapt his own behavior. Many problematic behavior cases I see while training dogs in Albuquerque originated in this way.

On the other hand – if the owner is predictable and kind, the puppy is much more likely to bond quickly and learn just as well – actually even much better 0 through positive reinforcement.",How do you discipline a puppy?,"As written above – you just don’t. Instead of trying to use loud noise, physical punishment, scolding or time-outs to change your dog’s behavior, good and effective training utilizes smart management and rewarding good choices.

Bad behavior disappears once we show our dog what it is that we want, and how good behavior pays off. Don’t try to discipline your dog in training – he will not learn a lot and may start to distrust you.

Instead, make training something he looks forward to by helping him learn through fun experiences. Especially for a new puppy this is very important: You absolutely want him to see you as a trustworthy, reliable and predictable friend and not someone who is punitive.

If you need more ideas, check out our free 14-day course below! It is not too late to start training even if your puppy is already a couple months old!",How to teach a puppy to sit ,"When first training your pup, it’s smart to work on obedience training. Commands like “sit” and “stay” are essential for your fur baby’s safety—so don’t wait to get started.

You’ll want to have a handful of your puppy’s favorite treats on hand, and remember to keep training sessions brief. Young pups have a short attention span, after all! Some pet parents find clickers to be helpful in marking the exact moment your pup sits. This might help your dog understand what behavior is wanted, making training go a bit faster.

To teach your puppy to sit, use the lure and reward training method shared by the American Kennel Club (AKC). While your dog is standing on all fours, hold a treat close to her nose, but instead of giving it to her, slowly move the treat over her head and back. Your dog will naturally follow the treat with her nose—and eventually sit to regain her balance. When she does, use your clicker and/or a verbal cue like “sit” and reward her immediately.

You did it! Now take a couple of steps away and call your puppy to get her to stand again, and then repeat the process. Repetition in small doses is helpful in solidifying new habits, so keep at it!",When Should One Start To Discipline A Puppy?,"At what age should you start disciplining your puppy?

Disciplining a puppy should start the moment you bring your new puppy home. Discipline imposed on your young puppy is part of their training.

Make sure to correct your pup’s bad behavior at the earliest opportunity. Start early and start them young!

As part of the initial dog training process, mild disciplining of pups is necessary. It is a way for your puppy to learn good behavior. It is like a soft or informal training for your puppies. As your puppy starts to grow, little by little, you teach your dog where to eat, where to drink, where to poop and pee, and other minor things like that. There will be days when they will forget how to do these small things and may exhibit bad behaviors, and that’s where discipline comes in. As part of disciplining them, they learn some habits and behaviors which will make your bond stronger.

With the help of some reinforcement, it is easier to teach our puppy good behavior.",What Does “Discipline” Entail?,"Disciplining your puppies requires proper training (e.g., puppy socialization classes), patience, and positive reinforcement. For extreme negative behavior, try to understand the reason behind such behavior.

Never punish your pet even if it keeps taking much of your attention. When you can no longer give that much attention to your dogs and what they need like when you are busy with work, you might want to hire a dog trainer. The dog trainer can execute effective training methods for your puppy to learn new and desirable attitudes.

The good thing about raising a puppy is that your young pup learns fast.

Likewise, your pup quickly remembers the new tasks he is taught. They easily learn a behavior when they are taught at the early stages of their lives. Just like raising a kid, there are times where your puppies may be too playful or naughty. Undesirable behavior may cause you to be annoyed, which is not a good thing for you and your pup. Hence, being a pet parent also requires a lot of patience.

Finally, positive reinforcements have always been proven effective in dog training.

To discipline your dog, make sure to have puppy treats at hand to let them know their positive behavior is appreciated.

Another example of positive reinforcement is to give your dog verbal praise. Even comforting sounds would do as long as they know that it is an appreciation of the way they behave.

Using dog toys like this Hartz DuraPlay Bacon Scented Dog Toys will give them lots of playtimes to occupy their minds.

Additionally, taking your dog for walks and bringing them outside to play and have some fun are other ways to reinforce good behavior."
how many times a day should a puppy eat,From Six To 12 Weeks,"Very young puppies, like human babies, need to eat several times throughout the day to stay energized and grow properly. Most puppies are already weaned from their mothers by the age of eight weeks when they are sent to their new owners and forever homes.

Whether you purchased or adopted your puppy, the breeder or the staff from the shelter should have told you the brand of puppy food your pup is used to eating.

If there is no dire need to change your puppyâs food to another formula, you should continue feeding the same food after you bring the pup home.

At this stage, puppies grow fast and need a lot of food and frequent meals to grow and develop properly. You should feed four equally spaced meals and make it a point that meals are always given at the same times of the day.

Sticking to a regular feeding schedule will help you immensely in potty training your puppy, since they need to eliminate 10 to 15 minutes after eating a meal.

By keeping a strict feeding schedule, you can predict when your puppy will need to go outside and give them an opportunity to relieve themselves in the designated potty area.

From six to 12 weeks of age, you should be feeding a complete and balanced puppy food that is specially formulated to meet the nutritional needs of a developing puppy.

When eating commercial puppy food, puppies can transition to unmoistened, dry puppy food by the age of nine to 10 weeks for large breed pups and by 12 to 13 weeks for small breeds.

If you are considering a homemade or raw diet, talk with your vet or canine nutritionist first. Preparing your pupâs food takes a lot of time and planning to get it right, and your pooch may be better off eating commercial puppy food.",From Three To Six Months,"At a three-month mark, you should consider cutting your puppyâs meals from four to three meals a day. Ideally, aim for feeding your puppy equally spaced breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same times every day.

While your growing puppy will be eating significantly larger meals than when you first brought them home, it will still need a high-calorie puppy food.

Most dogs start to lose their trademark chubby puppy appearance when they are around 12 weeks old. This is one of the signs you should look for when decreasing your pupâs feedings from four to three meals a day.

If your pup still has a potbelly and looks chubby at this stage, continue feeding four meals until its body starts to lose its puppy pudge.

And if you think that your pup is too chubby or, by contrast, too lanky, schedule an appointment with your vet and have your pooch examined. The solution may be as simple as tweaking your pupâs portion sizes and feeding more or less food for each meal.",When should I switch my puppy to two meals a day?,"The best time to switch your puppy from three to two meals a day is when they are between six and 12 months old. Keep in mind that most toy and small breed dogs can make the switch to two meals a day when they are between seven and nine months old.

Large and giant breeds, on the other hand, can continue eating three meals a day until they are between 12 and 14 months old.

There are many factors that affect your dogâs nutritional needs and the number of meals they should have during the day.

Spayed and neutered puppies, for example, are less energetic than their intact counterparts and therefore need less nutrient-dense food and fewer meals.

Generally, you can transition a spayed or neutered puppy to adult maintenance food, to lower their calorie intake and prevent obesity.",Puppy feeding chart,"How much to feed a puppy and how often to feed a puppy depends first and foremost on his age. The easiest way to remember how much to feed a puppy is to create a puppy feeding chart that matches your puppy’s breed and weight at maturity.

Very young puppies need to eat a high-quality puppy food diet approximately 3 to 4 times per day. The frequency of feeding puppies goes down to 3 times per day at around 3 to 6 months of age, and 2 times per day at around 6 to 12 months.

After about a year, most puppies can transition to a nutritionally balanced adult dog food diet 2 times per day.

*Toy and smaller breeds may be able to transition to adult food a little earlier (some as early as 7 to 9 months), while some giant breeds don’t reach adulthood until around 18-24 months. Ask your veterinarian for specific guidance here, and if you have any doubts as to when your puppy has officially become a full-grown dog, keep him on puppy food a little longer. When it comes to feeding puppies, it’s better to give a few extra nutrients than not enough.",What to feed puppies in the first year,"As a new pet parent, you’ll find no shortage of dog food choices for feeding puppies. Puppies grow at a rapid pace, and a few food transitions are to be expected.

Starting Solids: 8 weeks old

• Typically, solids introduced at 8 weeks of age.

• Transition the pup slowly to solids, usually over 5 – 7 weeks.

• At first, wet the kibble with water.

• Allow the kibble to soak for a few minutes so that’s it’s soft.

• Continue to wet the kibble with water over several weeks.

• Each week use 1 tsp less water to soften the food.

• By week 3 – 4, your puppy’s meals should be mostly crunchy kibble.

• At week 7, he should be fully transitioned onto the dry dog food.

Regular Feeding: 6 – 12 months old

• At 6 to 12 months establish regular eating times.

• Start serving 2 feedings per day.

• Create your own puppy feeding schedule routine.

• The first step on the schedule is to leave the bowl of food on the floor for a set amount of time.

• For beginners, start with 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how fast your dog eats.

• Be consistent with the schedule and always use the same place to feed your dog, same time, and same time period.

• Your dog will learn how this schedule works for the next 2 weeks.

• Once your puppy is familiar with regular meal times you’ll find that they’re followed by regular potty times.

• Bonus! More solid foods make picking up after your pup a lot easier.

Switching to Adult Dog Food: 1+ years

• Adult dog food is introduced from a year old.

• Transition your puppy slowly by mixing the new food into his puppy portions.

• Meals should be a mix of 75% puppy food to 25% adult food.

• Continue to serve mixed portions for about 2 – 3 days.

• Gradually increase the adult food and decrease the puppy food by 10%.

• By day 5 or 6, your puppy should be fully transitioned, eating 100% adult food.

• Patience is key and a slow transition will help your puppy’s stomach adjust.

• The whole process should take about a week."

The first shot is administered when the puppy is about 6-8 weeks old. At this age, the puppy will get a vaccination shot against distemper, parvovirus, and Bordetella, which is optional.

At 9-11 weeks, the puppy receives DHPP vaccines for adenovirus [hepatitis], distemper, parvovirus, and parainfluenza. You may also opt for other optional vaccinations for influenza, Bordetella, leptospirosis, and Lyme disease as per a veterinarian’s recommendation.

At 12-15 weeks, the puppy will get a DHPP rabies vaccine. At 16-20 weeks, the final shot gets administered. This shot will be against rabies. According to the puppy’s lifestyle, a veterinarian could recommend optional shots for influenza, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, and Bordetella.",How Many Shots Do Puppies Need Before Going Outside?,"Most veterinarians recommend that puppies wait until their final set of puppy shots at 16-18 weeks old. However, if the puppy has received proper immunization, it may be safe to be outside as early as 12 weeks.

After the first shot, puppies need to wait 7-10 days before going outside. At this time, the puppy can only move inside the house or compound. However, do not take the puppy out on walks.

After the second shot, the puppy should wait 14-21 days before going outdoors safely. At this time, you can take the puppy out for a walk. However, do not let it interact with other dogs yet.

Wait until the veterinarian has administered the third and fourth shot before allowing your puppy to mingle with others. After the waiting period, the puppy can interact with other dogs or go outdoors freely.

Remember that each puppy is different and that you should always check with your veterinarian for the best advice on when it is safe for your puppy to go outside.",How much do puppy shots cost?,"At PetSmart, puppy shots cost between $100 and $350 for the first year depending on which ones are needed.

how to potty train puppy,"Remember, Accidents Will Happen – How to Deal With It","Unless you’re Superman or Super Woman, or your puppy is a unicorn, accidents will happen. This is just the way it is, but the important thing is how you deal with it. Here’s what you need to remember how to potty train a puppy with love:

• Be Patient: Don’t punish your puppy when she pees or poops inside.

• Watch for Signs: If you don’t catch her in the act, just clean it up and keep a closer eye on your dog the next time. To be brutally honest: it’s your fault, not hers. You didn’t recognize the signs.

• Avoid Being Angry: You don’t want your puppy to be afraid of you or afraid to relieve herself in your presence. That will happen if you punish your puppy for doing something it needs to do by nature. Punishing will potentially do a lot of damage to your dog’s mental health, so don’t go down that road.

• Use Distraction: If you catch her in the act, you must interrupt her. Make a noise so you distract your pup, but avoid scaring her. Next, take her outside.

• Praise her: When you take the puppy out, be patient and wait for your pup to finish what she started inside, and praise her for doing so in the right place.",Dogs Smell Odors You Can’t,"A dog’s nose is about one million times stronger than ours. And this is good to have in mind as they prefer to go to the same spots to relieve themselves. This will help your training – or spoil it. So to help you and your puppy choose a specific spot to relieve herself, the scent will remind her to pee or poop right there.

This is also true if your puppy has had an accident inside. So, it’s important to clean up any accidents right away. Remember to use enzymatic cleanser rather than an ammonia-based cleaner to minimize odors.

Warning: Some cleansers can be lethal to the puppy if she gets a taste for it (see what else can harm your puppy). Rodalon is an example, so do your homework to protect your pet.",Puppy Potty Punchlines,"You may be reeling from all the information you’ve received on potty training, so here it is in a nutshell:

• Be patient.

• Be quick and consistent to get your puppy out from the first day.

• Set up a good routine with your puppy.

• Praise your puppy when she does what you want – let her know she’s a superstar.

• Never punish your puppy for having accidents. They will happen, but you can use them as a teaching moment by staying calm.

• Set your puppy up for success by keeping an eye on her always. Do this by restraining her area and using a crate to give both of you a break once in a while. You’ll only have to keep this close eye on her in a very short period of time and it will be time well invested. Soon she’ll be a grown calm and confident dog and be able to hold it for hours and hours.

• Accept that this, like all training, is a process. Look for what’s working and keep building on your wins and focus on getting better over time

Once your puppy is potty trained, you might want to work on training other behaviors. You may be interested in this post on puppy biting, this post on getting your dog to come every time you call or this post on getting and maintaining your dog’s attention, which is the most fundamental aspect of all obedience training. It is also helpful to practice with your dog before you take them to socialization or training classes.",How often do puppies need to go outside?,"The rule of thumb is a puppy can hold their bladder for how many months they are + 1. So a 3 month old puppy can usually hold their bladder for around 4 hours… once they are taught to do so. As our puppies get older, and by tracking their accidents, we can give them more and more time. It will be easier for them to hold it during the night when sleeping then during the day when awake. After 6 months of age puppies can generally hold it 6-8 hours – for many dogs they do achieve this before 6 months when a strong foundation is built.

In the beginning expect to wake up in the middle fo the night, for some puppies this is just for a few nights then they fall into their rhythm and sleep the whole night. Most dogs will bark and alert you when they need to be let out in the night.",Tips for success when going outside with your puppy:,"When taking your pet outside to go potty, the following tips will help:

• Take frequent trips outside to set your pet up for success, especially at the beginning as we are teaching them to hold their bladder.• When outside give them their verbal command such as ‘go potty’ but don’t keep repeating it. By saying it over and over we call their attention to us and not to the business they should be doing. This is a very common mistake. • Try to ignore your puppy but keep an eye on them out of the corner of your eye• Have a treat always on you when you start potty training but don’t rustle around your treat bag or your pup is going to think it’s obedience or training time. Need treat ideas? I have my favorites here. If those don’t work some boiled chicken or some roast beef works great too! • Try walking in slow small circles, this often helps get things moving – just as our pets walk in a circle before they go potty. If your pet usually goes in one area try slowly walking around there.• Verbally reward while they go, “good potty!”. Be excited for your pup!• REWARD generously immediately after your pet goes potty. As soon as they are done you should have the treat at their nose and throw them a little party.• Keep your outside sessions short, you shouldn’t be out there for 30 mins waiting for your pet to pee. 5 mins is more than enough!• Crate for success. Taking your pet out at all the above-mentioned times and if your pet doesn’t go, and they are due to – ie – drank a lot of water, had a play session, this is the time to use your crate. Have them spend 10-30 mins in the crate and try again immediately outside. This helps set our pets up for success. Repeat this process until they go. This will prevent accidents inside, teach them to actually hold their bladder (yes, that’s a skill) and helps you reward going potty outside. Key here: Do not let your pet loose indoors if they haven’t gone to the bathroom outside."
how much to feed puppy,Weaning Your Puppy to Solid Food ,"Weaning your puppy to solid food should not be an overnight endeavor but should ideally take place over the course of two to three weeks. First select the brand of puppy food you intend to feed. Puppies have high caloric and nutritional needs and so the food selected should be a high quality brand of puppy food. Talk to your veterinarian for specific recommendations but generally the best puppy foods will be a good source of protein, calcium and calories.

Starting around four to six weeks of age begin introducing your puppy to puppy food by making a gruel by blending the puppy food with milk replacer. Offer the gruel three to four times a day gradually reducing the amount of milk replaced used to make the gruel. This way your puppy gradually learns to adapt to solid food and gastric upset is minimized. By around eight weeks of age your puppy should be eating solid food.",Move on From Puppy Food,"Puppy food is very high in calories and nutritional supplements so you want to switch to adult food once your puppy begins to approach maturity. There is no set age when the switch should be made because it will vary with the breed and individual dog.

In general, the smaller the dog the faster they reach maturity. Small breeds up to 30 pounds mature around ten to twelve months of age although some toy breeds reach maturity even sooner. Medium breed dogs up to 80 pounds will reach maturity between twelve to sixteen months and I believe your puppy may fall into this category. It really depends how much Great Pyrenees she has in her. Large breed dogs weighing more than 80 pounds can take up to two years to reach maturity.

When making the switch to adult food, do it slowly over the course of one to two weeks by gradually mixing in increasing amounts of the adult food with decreasing amounts of her puppy food to minimize gastric upset.",How much to feed a puppy,"Getting a new puppy is exciting, but it is no simple task either, especially if you are a first-time owner. There is a lot to know before bringing your new puppy home to ensure you are suitably prepared and that he or she will be comfortable. Some of the biggest conundrums are to do with the best puppy food for your dog, and how to properly feed puppies – after all, you can’t trust your puppy to tell you; they are likely to eat whatever is put under their nose!

Perhaps you already own a puppy or have had one in the past, but want to see if you can learn something new? Whatever your circumstances, this puppy feeding guide tackles the most common and pressing questions new puppy owners ask when it comes to nourishing their dog.

Roughly, toy, small and medium dog breeds mature between six to 12 months, while large breeds, who have much more growing to do, mature at 12 to 18 months, although some can take longer. For advice on your puppy’s specific breed, check their food packaging, or consult a vet.

If your dog liked the food you had been feeding them as a puppy, it is a good idea to stick to the same flavours when transitioning to adult dog food. Start slowly by feeding your dog 90% of their usual puppy food with 10% of the new adult food mixed in. Then, once you are sure your dog is eating their food without any problems, you can gradually increase the ratio of adult food to puppy food over the course of a week or two.",Is Puppy Food Different To Adult Dog Food?,"While puppy food should have many of the same ingredients as adult dog food, puppy meals tend to have higher concentrations of essential nutrients. This is because puppies have different requirements to older dogs; just as human babies have different diets to adult humans. Puppies have a lot of growing and developing to do and building these tissues requires lots of protein, calcium and numerous other nutrients, as well as lot of energy.

Feeding a puppy adult dog food means you will need to feed them more often to ensure they get the nutrients they need, or risk stunting their development. One interesting example to illustrate this is that smaller dogs, including puppies, have a higher surface-to-volume ratio than larger dogs, which means that, relative to the amount of body heat they can create, smaller dogs have a larger area through which to lose heat. It is for this reason that puppies don’t only need to eat and exercise more to keep their body temperature at normal levels, but why many tend to love a nice heated dog bed.

Equally, feeding an adult dog puppy food can also be dangerous, as it can lead to an overload of nutrients which can lead to problems later in life. For example, large dogs are already prone to skeletal issues, which the extra calcium in puppy food can exacerbate."
how long to go between puppy vaccinations,When can my Puppy Go Outside After Vaccination?,"After your pup’s second round of initial vaccinations, he will be able to go out for walks with you one week later. Although it’s tempting to take him out earlier, it is incredibly important to listen to your vet’s advice. Puppy vaccinations are vital for helping your pup avoid infectious diseases by forming a resistance to viruses, but they take a little while to work properly. If you take your pup for a walk before one week from his second vaccination, you run the risk of exposing him to a dangerous virus that he will not yet be equipped to deal with.

The only way to make sure your puppy gets the best start in life is to make sure he receives his vaccinations on time and that you avoid taking him out in public until one week has passed from his second vaccination.",What Is The Risk If I Take My Puppy Out Too Early?,"Although it might seem harmless to let your pup go out for a walk early, doing so before he’s had a chance to build his immunity exposes him to all kinds of dangerous viruses and potentially life-threatening illnesses.

The vaccinations your puppy receives at eight and ten weeks protects against viruses like Canine Parvovirus, Parainfluenza and Canine Distemper, as well as bacterial infections such as Leptospirosis.

Parvovirus is an extremely dangerous and highly contagious virus that can attack a dog’s intestinal lining, stopping them from being able to digest food properly. In many cases, Parvovirus is fatal, especially for puppies who aren’t strong enough to fight the infection. Parainfluenza is a respiratory virus that can lead to kennel cough, and Canine Distemper can infect the central nervous system, leading to seizures and is also potentially fatal.

These illnesses are avoidable if the proper precautions are taken, but unfortunately, every year dogs arrive in veterinary practices throughout the UK with illnesses related to these viruses. That’s why it is so important to make sure your puppy is vaccinated and that you give those vaccinations the proper time to work.

Canine viruses are spread through contact with urine, faeces, blood and saliva from infected dogs. Letting your puppy out on a walk before it’s safe to do so means risking him coming into contact with this infectious material. Even in places that seem safe, viruses like Parvovirus can live in the soil for up to a year and are resistant to weather and temperature fluctuations. It just isn’t worth it to take the chance – which is why vets recommend waiting the full week after vaccination before taking your pup out in public.",When Can My Puppy Go Out In The Garden?,"Letting your puppy out in the garden is important for toilet training – establishing good routines early will make the process a lot quicker in the long run. That said, you may be wondering “when can my puppy go out in the garden?”

Even though it’s important to wait until your pup’s immunity has been built up before you take him out in public, you may be okay to let your puppy roam your own private garden as long as a few conditions are met.

First, it’s important to wait until after your pup has had his first round of vaccinations, even before letting them out in your garden. This is because your garden still poses a risk – other animals such as foxes can carry disease that can be passed on to dogs. Although the first round of vaccinations alone won’t completely protect them from risk, it gives their immune system a boost. Most owners weigh the risk of infectious diseases from their garden against the risk of left-too-late toilet training – if in doubt you’re best to consult your vet.

It’s important to make sure that no unvaccinated dogs have been in your garden in the past before letting your pup out. Remember that Canine Parvovirus has been known to live in soil for as long as a year. If you’re unsure, wait until after your puppy is fully vaccinated.",WHAT AGE SHOULD MY PUPPY BE VACCINATED?,"When they are first born, puppies receive protection against infectious disease from their mother in her colostrum. Unfortunately this protection doesn’t last very long, and as it starts to fade, we need to vaccinate them so they produce their own immunity. We want the period of time when they are unprotected to be as short as possible, so vaccinations are usually started from 8-10 weeks of age, though they may be given younger if there is a risk they inherited little protection from their dam.

As we don’t know exactly when the protection from the dam wanes, young puppies are given more than one dose of vaccine, to maximise their chance of responding to them.

Here at Orchard Vets, our routine puppy vaccination program is as follows:

• 8-10 weeks of age: First distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus and leptospirosis vaccination.• 2 weeks after first vaccine: Second distemper, hepatitis and parvovirus vaccination (must be older than 10 weeks)• 4 weeks after first vaccine: second leptospirosis vaccination.",WHEN CAN I TAKE MY PUPPY OUT AFTER THEIR VACCINATIONS?,"Before their first vaccination, your puppy should not be walked in public areas. Puppies should still be exposed to new sights, sounds, smells and experiences, but they should be carried, and not allowed on the ground in public areas. Access to your own secure garden is generally safe, as long as you have not previously had a dog with infectious disease. If you have friends with healthy dogs that are fully vaccinated, it is safe for the puppy to meet these dogs.

After their first vaccination, puppies will not necessarily develop significant immunity, so the advice above should still be followed.

As long as your puppy is 10 weeks old or older at their second vaccination, they will be immune to distemper, hepatitis and parvovirus one week after this vaccination. So, one week after their second vaccination, your puppy can be walked in public areas, and usually attend puppy classes. They will not be protected against leptospirosis yet, and areas that are high risk for lepto – for example stagnant water, areas with rat infestations, livestock farms – should be avoided.

Your puppy’s third and final vaccination will be their second leptospirosis vaccine, which must be given 4 weeks after the first. Onset of immunity after the second L4 vaccination is not until 3 weeks after this injection, so you should continue to avoid areas with a high leptospirosis risk after this."
how much to feed a puppy by weight,"How To Bottle Feed Puppies 
","While it is best for a puppy to be fed directly by his mother, sometimes it isn’t possible like if the puppy was orphaned, he was separated from his mother, or perhaps his mother is not well enough to feed her puppies.

In that case, you will have to learn how to bottle feed a puppy.

To begin with, you will need to make sure that you have a milk alternative that is made specifically for puppies.

Mother’s milk is full of nutrients specific to the growth of puppies, so the next best thing is to use a formula that has been made for puppies.

With the formula, you will want to follow its instructions as far as the quantity of milk powder to water goes.

Then, you will want to make sure that the milk is as warm as body temperature. They make bottle warms for this purpose, or you can place the bottle in a hot cup of water to bring up the temperature of the milk.

After making sure the nipple of the bottle is working correctly, lay the puppy across your lap and feed him while he is on his belly.

This is a natural way that they feed. You will know that he is done when he stops swallowing the milk.","How To Wean Puppies 
","Whether you have been bottle-feeding your puppy or if he is getting milk from his mother, he will need to wean off of the milk in order to move onto puppy food.

This should start to happen when the puppy is around 5 weeks old.

When you begin the weaning process, you will want to use a nutrient-rich puppy food that has been softened or watered-down to make it easier to for the puppy to manage.

If the puppy is not immediately interested, you can try to get the puppy to taste the food right from your finger.

If your puppy is not immediately interested at 5 weeks, you might need to try again in a week.

There is no perfect rule on how it should be done and it will vary a lot depending on the dog himself. When he does seem interested, begin feeding him more food, more frequently until he loses interest in nursing.

Offer the puppy food 3 to 4 times a day, even while the puppy is still nursing. This is even more important with small breeds because their blood sugar will drop if they are not fed often enough. A puppy should be completely weaned by 8 weeks old.","How Often To Feed A Puppy
","4-12 Weeks

The frequency that you need to feed your puppy will vary from 4 to 6 meals a day.

You should be able to move to 4 meals a day by the time the puppy is 8 weeks old. 4 meals will help the puppy meet his caloric daily needs as he is growing quickly and burning energy.

The quantity of food will depend entirely on the dog breed and size of the dog, but the frequency is the same.

3-12 Months

Between 3 and 12 months of age, the frequency that you are feeding the puppy will change. At between 3 and 4 months, you should be able to reduce the feeding frequency down to 3 times a day.

At 6 months, you should reduce that to just 2 meals a day. This can happen a little later if you are holding off having your dog spayed or neutered as unfixed dogs require more calories.

12+ Months

When your puppy has reached one year and older, you should be able to keep him on the two meals a day. Do not reduce your dog down to one meal a day.

It will make him ravenous while he waits for a daily meal and reduces his energy. Instead, make sure it is 2 equal meals a day. Your pup might even continue growing until he is 18 months old, so keep that in mind as well.",Puppy feeding guidelines,"Puppies should be fed  a % of their actual body weight SEE CHART BELOW until approximately 6 months or so, split into 3 or more meals per day depending on age. Puppies require a great deal of food for good bone & muscle development and a little extra edible bone as they are building their adult teeth. It is important not let puppies get too thin at this age as their energy demands are tremendous when cutting new teeth.

After the age of 6 months refer to our Adult feeding guidelines

Puppies can be fed raw straight from weaning and can progress to fish/wings/carcass etc from 6 -8 weeks. Minces and minced carcass are similar to the regurgitated food they would get from their mothers in the wild. Build slowly onto chunkier meats and soft bone – meaty chicken ribs, necks or chicken or duck wings are good to build their jaw strength.

For puppies – Chicken wings should have the wing tip cut off at the third joint, as, should the puppy be tempted to swallow it whole, the double joint of the wing is a major choking hazard for pups.

Puppies cut teeth between 4 & 6 months so, good meaty bones of a suitable size Turkey, Lamb, Chicken necks or Lamb flat rib or breast bones are fantastic for them to gnaw on.

Weight bearing bones such as marrow bones or legs should not be fed until 1yr of age

I suggest starting gently by choosing a puppy formula if available or 1 simple protein – either tripe or chicken mince is a good starter – at around 4.5months (smaller breeds) & 6 months (larger breeds) 7-9mths (giant breeds),start to introduce another protein – repeat this process every 1 or 2 weeks or so still checking stools, until he/she is receiving a balanced variety of different meats/offal/organ meats and meaty bones.

Eggs (whole and shell) as well as natural yoghurt are a great added supplement to their diet.

We would love to hear how you are getting on with your puppy feeding, please feel free to drop us a line and post pictures on our Facebook page",How much should I feed my puppy?,"Your new puppy is a bundle of joy and energy. That’s why they live for play sessions and chew toys, not to mention romps all over your bed/couch/yard. It’s also partly why puppies sleep so much – they expend energy quickly and need to replenish their stores so they can get the zoomies all over again.

All of that growth and development is also why puppies need more calories than adult dogs. Be sure to buy food that’s formulated for puppies (or for dogs at all life stages) rather than just for adult dogs.  If you have a large breed puppy, choose large breed puppy food to support normal growth and development of the skeletal system. This ensures your puppy will get the right balance of nutrients – as well as the right caloric density.

So, you’ve chosen the right food. Now, how much do you give your pup? Generally, the feeding instructions on the label of your pet food will provide good guidance. Your vet is another great resource. But to truly understand how your puppy’s calorie needs are determined, you’ll need to know their weight – and their resting energy requirement."

And remember, puppyhood is fast and is gone before you know it. Make sure to savor the time when your pup is young, and take lots of pictures along the way!",Come When Called.,"Coming when called is the most valuable skill any dog will learn. It’s a behavior that might literally save his life. While I use several techniques to teach and maintain a strong recall behavior, simple classical conditioning is always on my list, and is something I practice during every meal.

Classical conditioning is about creating strong associations in a dog’s mind. When I know a dog loves food, and is excited about mealtime, I can easily transfer some of that love and excitement onto my recall word by saying the word a split second before reaching for and feeding a bite of food.

It doesn’t matter what the dog is doing at the time. He can be sitting, standing, etc. What matters is that he hears his recall word and food magically lands in his mouth no more than two seconds later. I can easily rapid-fire my way through 25 rounds of “Saber, here!” in about a minute, and consider this a valuable piece of our recall maintenance training.",Formal Stay.,"When a dog is motivated to eat, earning a bowl of food is a powerful reinforcer. After my young dogs have learned that remaining calm is the key to keeping me on-task with meal prep, I use feeding time as a prime opportunity for teaching the sit-stay.

Start small, by asking for just five seconds of self-control via a sit-stay as you hold your dog’s bowl of food. If the dog breaks position – including calmly lying down or standing up (since you specifically asked for a sit-stay) – simply set the bowl on the counter and disengage from your dog for 30 seconds or so. It’s wise to busy yourself during this time so that it’s easier to remain disengaged from a dog who might try and pester you as he works to figure out what just happened.

Also, there’s no need to reprimand or otherwise correct the dog when he breaks position. The goal is for your dog to realize that his action (breaking position) is what’s causing the dinner delay.

After 30 to 60 seconds, return to the kitchen, pick up his bowl, ask him to “sit” and “stay” and try again. Chances are good that his “Ah-ha!” moment will come within three tries. When he’s successful, and you reach your five-second count, be sure to use a clear release word (I like, “OK!”) before inviting him to eat. The release word lets him know that this time, getting up won’t result in you removing the bowl.

As he gets the hang of things, be sure to change up how long you ask him to stay, sometimes asking for more, sometimes surprising him with an easy, short stay, but always ending with the release word.",What is Free Feeding? ,"Much like it sounds, free feeding is the practice of leaving an unlimited amount of food in the bowl for your dog to graze on throughout the day. When asked why they choose this option, many owners cite convenience as the primary reason.

One of the problems with this method, however, is that many dogs—while not all—will struggle with portion control. In the wild, a dog may only receive a meal once a week. So naturally, their instinct is to eat as much as possible, not knowing when their next meal will come. Unfortunately, for the domestic dog, this impulse can easily lead to obesity. In fact, 56 percent of dogs in the United States are overweight or obese. That means the problem of overfeeding impacts one out of every two dogs.

If you have a multi-dog household, you will also encounter the issue of monitoring each individual dog’s daily intake. More assertive dogs may intimidate their submissive siblings and steal their portions, leaving some dogs overfed, and the others malnourished.",What is Scheduled Feeding? ,"In most cases, veterinarians recommend scheduled feeding for their four-legged patients. This means that you are feeding your pooch a set amount of kibble, or alternative food, one to two times a day. Some dogs will do well receiving one meal a day while others do best with two. The key here is to offer a strict portion in accordance with their specific dietary needs.

If your dog is new to scheduled feeding, they may struggle with this method a bit. You’ll want to monitor him while he eats to ensure he isn’t inhaling his food or eating from his housemates’ bowls. If you’re in a home with multiple dogs, you’ll find this practice makes it easier to gently remind each dog to stay at his own bowl and not interfere with his furry pals.

When it comes to scheduled feeding or free feeding, at East Valley Animal Hospital, we highly recommend scheduled feeding because of its many benefits. Scheduled feeding is more sanitary, it allows you to easily track your companion’s food intake which can help alert you to possible sickness, it offers a bonding opportunity, and it allows you to estimate when your dog will need to relieve himself. If you’re struggling with the transition to a scheduled feeding system or need help understanding your dog’s specific nutritional needs, give us a call at 480-568-2462.

when can puppies go outside,Going Out in the Yard,"In mild weather, even newborn puppies can be taken out to your own garden or backyard, as long as they're supervised and confined to a small, safe area. Of course, nursing puppies would likely be taken out along with their mother and the rest of the litter. Once they're big enough to start wandering around on their own and going to the bathroom without Mom's assistance, they're big enough to start going outside to be potty trained, says Christopher Carter Veterinary Surgery. Again, they should be closely supervised, and trips outside should be kept short.

If you're not raising a puppy from birth, chances are by the time you adopt your pup he'll be fully weaned and big enough to explore the yard under your watchful eye. Dogtime recommends taking your newly adopted puppy outside for potty breaks every one to two hours. By this point he's also old enough to be introduced to a collar and leash in preparation for going on walks or being taken out to public spaces.

Weather is a major factor in whether it's safe for your pup to venture outdoors. Puppies are extremely vulnerable to temperature extremes, says Dogtime. In sub-freezing temperatures, very young puppies or toy breed pups should be kept inside and allowed to do their business on a puppy training pad. Older, larger pups, especially those that are bred for cold weather, such as huskies or St. Bernards, may be able to take short trips outside in cold weather to do their business, but should return inside as soon as they're done.

Similarly, puppies are particularly susceptible to heat-related illnesses. If you're facing hot weather, keep visits outside short, and never leave your puppy outside unsupervised on a hot day.",Related Articles,"Do Puppies Need All These Vaccines?

However, even though it is easy to eliminate the dangerous things such as electronics that you can see, it gets quite difficult to get rid of diseases such as parvovirus and distemper that you cannot see.

Luckily, research and vaccinations have made things easy for puppy owners. With the right vaccinations being administered at the right time, all the diseases that might pose a threat to the life of puppies can be prevented.

However, this is not as easy as people might think. This is because, at the age when puppies are getting their first vaccination sets, they are also developing and growing. The sets of vaccines and the development phase ends when they hit sixteen weeks of age.",Should You Socialize Your Puppies?,"Research has shown that puppies that fail to get enough chances to socialize and get introduced to different and new environments before they hit sixteen weeks of age have high chances of developing issues with their behavior.

This might include things such as aggression, anxiety, and fear. There might even be high levels of aggression when they hit adolescence. These problems are going to affect the health of your puppy in one way or another.

If your puppy does not want to socialize, then it means that there is a problem with it. You might need to consider consulting online vets who can visit you and find out what could be wrong.

Now that we know that you need to socialize your puppies, when is the right time to start taking them outside? Well, this depends on where and at what age you are taking them outside.",Taking Puppies Outside For the First Time,"Before getting to eighteen weeks of age, puppies get three sets of vaccinations. The vaccinations become fully effective after about seven days after administration. These sets of vaccination are administered as follows;

Six to eight weeks against parvovirus and distemper diseases.

Ten to twelve weeks against influenza, bordetella, and DHPP.

Sixteen to eighteen weeks against influenza, bordetella, rabies, and DHPP.

After the first round of vaccination (six to eight weeks), you can take your puppies outside. This should be about seven days after they are vaccinated. Those that have yards at home can let the puppies wander around the yards but under close watch.

Those that live in apartments should not do this. They can, however, select a single spot where they can carry their puppy to at certain times of the day. The bottom line is, you should never let the puppy at this age go to any public space.

The exception to this is that you can take the puppy outside, including public spaces as long as they are in a puppy carrier."
how to train a puppy not to bite,How to prevent problem chewing,"You don’t want your dog to harm a person or another dog by biting, or to ruin your furniture, but they’ll need opportunities to chew. That’s a key part of their lives both as teething puppies and adult dogs. So if your dog is taking too much of an interest in chewing on you, the legs of your couch, or your once-mint-condition vintage Reebok Pumps, give them better gnawing options: chews and chew toys specifically designed for dogs.

“I tell people that their goal for chewing and puzzling toys is three-plus hours a day cumulatively,” Herman says; she’s especially fond of toys with food in them, which can keep dogs mentally engaged with a chance to “hunt.” All in all, it’s ideal for your dog to have approved toys and chews that they can turn to when they feel an inclination toward mastication.

Some trainers recommend putting a dog-safe spray with an unpleasant taste on off-limits furniture to stop your dog from gnawing on it. Even if this method is effective in the short term, it’s not addressing the root problems behind problem chewing. “Are you going to coat your house in the anti-chew spray?” Herman asks.

Other dogs and people can be assets in your quest to curb unwanted chewing; play with other pups and gentle games of fetch and tug-of-war with humans will give your dog constructive outlets for their desire to chew. They’ll expend some extra energy and have fun. Even beyond this individual issue, socialization will give your pal a big nudge toward better habits and a happier life—so do what you can to safely expose them to a variety of people and situations at a young age (read more about socializing a puppy here).

Using the tips above to create a training plan that works for you, and following it with patience and consistency, can set your puppy up to become an adult dog who happily sinks their teeth only into items designated for that purpose.

How Do I Stop My Dog From Biting When Excited?

Some dogs get overly excited when they’re playing, which can lead to nipping and biting. Although dogs consider this part of the fun, it can be dangerous. It’s best to avoid such activities as playing tug-of-war with toys, wrestling, or other forms of play that encourage aggressive behavior.

Adult dogs can bite for different reasons compared to puppy play biting (although some adult dogs might nip and bite during play, especially if they weren’t appropriately trained as puppies). It’s essential to understand factors that may provoke biting and aggressive behavior in dogs.

Here are some of the most common reasons dogs bite.

• Defending themselves if they feel threatened or provoked• Feeling scared or have been suddenly startled• Protecting their territory or “property,” such as toys, food, puppies, or even their owner• Injury or illness — they want to be left alone if not feeling well• Running away from a dog may provoke biting

If you have a puppy that loves to nip at your feet and ankles when you walk, you’ll definitely want to nip that behavior in the bud early. This behavior is especially common in herding breeds.

To get your puppy to stop biting at your ankles, keep a toy in your pocket when you are on the move. If your puppy starts to bite, stop moving and wave the toy around to get his attention until he bites the toy.

In instances of ankle biting when you don’t have a toy handy, wait for your dog to release on his own and then praise the action. This teaches your dog that he will be rewarded for good behavior. Eventually, your dog should stop nipping at your heels."
how much food to feed a puppy,Puppy feeding chart explained,"Although they may look complicated, puppy feeding charts are actually pretty straightforward. Our puppy feeding chart uses the expected weight of adult dog to determine how much food to feed at a given age. Most puppy food charts follow this same rationale.

Simply use the left-most column of the feeding chart to determine the correct row to use to calculate feeding amounts. As mentioned earlier, you'll need to know the expected weight of adult dog for your breed. If you're unsure we suggest using Google. Remember to consider the sex of your puppy at this stage as dogs will grow more than bitches.

Now that you know the row to use, simply use the correct age column of the puppy feeding chart to see how much food to feed. This should tell you how many grams of kibble to feed a puppy per day. It is that easy!

An example puppy feeding chart",My puppy isn't eating enough,"When your new puppy arrives home it can be a stressful event for them. During the first few days, it can cause their appetite or digestion to be a little off-kilter. Try not to worry about this too much as it is perfectly normal.

• Puppy – feed them twice or thrice a day

• Adult dog – feed them once a day

Puppies usually nurse as much as they want off their mother’s milk for the first 8 weeks. After they are about 1 month old, they can start eating some watered-soaked dry food, to help them transit to solid food and getting a wider range of nutrients.

When they are above 2 months old, they can start eating solid food twice a day.

When is my puppy considered an adult dog?

When a dog reaches 90% of its estimated adult weight, you can consider it to be an adult dog and adjust the feeding schedule, type of dog food, and amount accordingly. Adult dog food should help your dog to maintain their weight and size with proper nutrients (instead of giving them to grow).

Most dogs grow out of their puppies’ growing stages by 7 months, though some larger breeds may take 1 year over to reach their adult stage.

As you can guess, puppies eat more, and there are special diets for puppies with higher minerals and proteins for growth. An adult dog needs to eat less than a puppy to prevent them from getting fat. Senior dogs are elderly and start to have weaker jaws, hence they may prefer softer food and started to eat less as their metabolism decreases.

If your dog suffers from health conditions, you may also take precautions on his food. You may have to consult a veterinarian about the type of food, amount, and schedule for your dog. There are a few common health conditions, such as urinary stones, kidney diseases, weight issues, or heart and liver problems that trouble dogs.

Every dog is unique. If your dog is very active and likes to run around your home daily, you may feed him more than the estimated amount for his breed. On the other hand, if your dog likes to laze around, and sleep more, you may want to reduce his food intake to match his low calories usage.

Do observe your dog and see if his weight is optimal, though most of us dog owners tend to overfeed our dogs and have dogs with fat problems, some of us may unknowingly give too little dog food and cause them to have skinnier frames than usual.

Remember, dogs are our living love, and their preferences and needs do change with times!"
when do puppies eyes open,Birth to 2 Weeks: From Closed to Open Eyes,"Puppies are always born with their eyes closed, which are still developing after birth. They are born without the ability to open them because they don’t really need their vision right away. Their bodies cannot move well, and the mother is typically nearby to feed, so vision isn’t the most important sense to have as newborns. Along with their eyes being closed, newborn puppies also have closed ears at birth.

It generally takes around 10–14 days for the eyes to open, or around two weeks of age. While this may seem like a long time, it’s perfectly natural and a necessary part of puppy growth. However, their eyes at this stage are far from being done with developing. Their vision will be very blurry, both close up and with distance, but they’ll be able to blink, open, and move their eyes.",Why Aren’t a Puppy’s Eyes Fully Developed Before Birth?,"Many animals are born with their eyes fully formed and open. So, why don’t puppies fall into that category?

One reason is that a mother dog can protect and care for her helpless puppies after they are born. So, the puppies can safely move through this stage of development while under the watch of their mother.

Another reason why puppies are born with closed eyes has to do with a dog’s gestation period. The pregnancy period of most dogs lasts from 58 to 68 days. Though this gestation period is relatively short, it’s enough time for a puppy’s lungs, heart, kidneys, and other major organs to form. However, the gestation period is not quite long enough for a puppy’s vision to fully develop. Fortunately, vision development along with the development of its hearing can continue after a puppy is born.",When Do Puppies Open Their Eyes?,"Generally, puppies open their eyes at ten to fourteen days old. It takes that long for the full development of a puppy’s optic nerve. But, when you think about it, a puppy doesn’t need to see until it’s further along in its life.

Puppies sleep a lot during their first few weeks of life. While they are sleeping, there’s a lot of growth happening behind their eyelids. Puppies aren’t moving around and exploring yet so they don’t need to be able to open their eyes right from birth. Also, newborn puppies spend a lot of time nursing from their mother. They quickly become used to the smell of their mother so it’s not hard for them to wiggle around to find a place to nurse. A puppy’s sense of smell is their strongest sense even after their eyes and ears open up.",Can Puppies See Perfectly Immediately After They Open Their Eyes?,"No. A puppy may have its eyes partially open for several hours or even a day before the lids open completely. This means a bit of time has to pass before a puppy can see clearly. As it opens its lids, a puppy is likely to see things through a gray haze until it can focus properly.

It’s important to take special care when walking around a puppy with its eyes only partially open. Keep in mind the puppy may not be able to judge where things are in its environment. You don’t want to step on it or let it get itself into a dangerous situation.

Also, it’s best to avoid quick movements around a puppy until it can see clearly. A puppy may become frightened by the quick movements of something it can’t see very well. Wouldn’t you? Using a soft, calming voice when talking to the puppies during this time is a good idea as well. You want to do everything you can to set them at ease while they are in this vulnerable stage of development.",When to talk to your vet,"The process of opening their eyes will come easily and naturally for most puppies—but you still want to keep an eye on things to make sure the process is going correctly with your puppy.

Some red flags that something may be wrong with your puppy’s eye development include:

• Swelling or bulging under the eyelid. If you notice there is any swelling or bulging under your puppy’s eyelids before they open, it may be a sign of infection.

• Pus or discharge from the eye area. If there is any pus, discharge, or eye gunk in or around the eyelid area, it also may be a sign of infection.

• Your puppy’s eyelids don’t open by two weeks of age. Some breeds take longer to open their eyelids than others, but if the two-week mark comes and goes without your puppy opening their eyes, it might be a sign of a developmental issue.

If you notice any of these symptoms, make an appointment with your vet. She will be able to diagnose any infection or eye development issues and prescribe the best course of treatment for your puppy."
why do puppies get hiccups,What Causes Hiccups in Dogs?,"Just like in humans, a spasm in the diaphragm, the muscle under the lungs, causes hiccups in dogs. The spasm causes the glottis, the opening between the vocal cords, to close abruptly. This results in a “hic” sound. Puppies will sometimes get hiccups after eating or drinking too fast, when they are tired, when they are very excited, or when they’re too cold.

Scientists don’t actually know why humans, dogs, and other mammals hiccup. One theory is that hiccups are a leftover from when we were developing in utero. Fetal hiccups have been documented in many mammalian species. It could be that hiccuping in the womb is a way of test-driving the breathing muscles.

This theory might explain why hiccups are much more common in puppies than in adult dogs. As your puppy gets older, he will probably hiccup less frequently, or not at all.

Another theory is that hiccups are your puppy’s way of relieving gas or an upset tummy.",How Can You Get Rid of Dog Hiccups?,"Hiccups usually go away on their own. There are, of course, many wives’ tales about how to get rid of human hiccups, such as holding your breath, pulling on your tongue, or being scared. But no one knows whether these really work.

There’s no point in trying to scare your dog or pull his tongue to get his hiccups to go away. The scaring or tongue pulling (or whatever other remedy you use) will probably bother him more than the hiccups do.

But there are three things that you can do that may be helpful to your hiccuping pup.

• Calm Irregular Breathing. Help your dog’s breathing pattern become more steady and rhythmic. Usually if you get him to lay on his back and give him a nice tummy rub, it can help the hiccups subside.

• Drink Water. Like with humans, drinking water can assist with hiccups. Just make sure that your dog drinks it calmly and slowly.

• Slow Down at Dinner. Hiccups can occur if your dog is eating too fast. Try feeding him smaller portions at a time to avoid hiccups.",What Are Hiccups?,"Hiccups are caused by an involuntary contraction of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a very thin, but very strong dome-shaped sheet of muscle that separates the thorax from the abdominal cavity in all mammal species.

The diaphragm is the main muscle that helps us control our breathing. When we breathe in, the diaphragm muscle contracts, and moves down towards the abdominal cavity. This expands the space of the thorax and creates a vacuum force that allows the lungs to fill up with air. When we exhale, the opposite happens, the diaphragm muscle relaxes and returns to its dome shape, reducing the thoracic cavity’s space and forcing air out of our lungs.

Hiccups happen when there is a spasm in the diaphragmatic muscle. This causes a series of abrupt and involuntary contractions of the abdomen that result in a series of very forced air movements in and out of the lungs. When the forced air is expelled and passes through the glottis, it triggers the vocal structures to close suddenly, creating that loud and characteristic “HICC-UP” noise.",Why Do Puppies Get Hiccups Frequently?,"It is fairly common for puppies to get hiccups. Puppies tend to get hiccups far more frequently than adult dogs. The theory is that puppies are so full of energy, and they tend to get overexcited as they discover the world and their surroundings, which has an impact on their breathing pattern. Puppies tend to drink water faster, gulp on their food faster, and run around more frequently, all these factors increase the possibility of them getting hiccups.

Another theory is that a fit of hiccups is related to the developing and growing muscles and organs in their bodies. Puppies can get hiccups in their sleep—some of them without even waking up! And even before birth, developing puppies in the womb and other mammals’ fetuses can get hiccups—including humans! Scientists believe this is some kind of test drive of the respiratory muscle function. So, all these factors add up and are the reason why generally puppies tend to get hiccups more frequently than adult dogs.",What Can I Do to Stop My Puppy’s Hiccups?,"Normally hiccups will resolve by themselves after a while. There are a lot of theories about ways to stop hiccups, but none of them are a scientific cure. Helping your puppy relax and calm down will help to normalize their breathing pattern. A slow walk or a chest massage can be of great help as well. Offering your puppy some water could be of help too. Some owners report that offering a sweet syrup such as honey, maple, or corn syrup has worked on their dogs. The sweetness distracts the puppies from the hiccups and helps them to calm down. You can give this a try, but do not turn it into a habit as too much sugar is not good for your puppy’s teeth and overall health.

Please do not try to scare your puppy or pull its tongue as these are remedy myths that do not work and will only damage the trust relationship the puppy is starting to build with you and other humans."
how do puppies get parvo,"
How is Parvo diagnosed?","The clinical signs of Parvo infection can appear similar to many other diseases that cause vomiting and diarrhea. The confirmation of Parvo infection is often achieved by isolating virus antigen in the stool.

There is a simple in-clinic test for Parvo that will screen for this disease. Occasionally, a dog will have Parvovirus but test negative for virus in the stool. Fortunately, this is an uncommon occurrence. A tentative diagnosis is often based on the presence of a reduced white blood cell count (leukopenia) and clinical signs. The absence of leukopenia does not mean that the dog does not have Parvo infection since some dogs that become clinically ill may not have a low white blood cell count.

Your Veterinarian may want to do additional tests (fecal flotation, bloodwork and abdominal radiographs) to confirm that your dog does not have any other illness or condition that may complicate treatment for Parvo infection.","
How does infection with CPV make a dog sick?","Parvo first infects the tonsils and lymph nodes in the mouth, and then travels via the lymphocytes (white blood cells) to the bloodstream. Once in the blood stream, the virus attacks rapidly dividing cells, including the cells that line the intestinal tract, bone marrow and the heart.

The virus causes destruction of the epithelial cells of the small intestine, which is the lining that helps to absorb nutrients and provides a barrier against fluid loss and bacterial invasion from the gut into the body. Severe diarrhea and nausea are the initial result, but eventually the intestinal surface can become so damaged that it begins to break down, and the bacteria that are normally contained in the gut penetrate the intestine walls and enter the bloodstream. To make matters worse, the body’s immune system is already weakened, as its ability to produce new white blood cells to fight infection has been hampered by the invasion of Parvo into the bone marrow. Parvo is not always fatal, but when it does kill, death is as a result of either dehydration and/or shock, along with the effects of septic toxins produced by the intestinal bacteria roaming throughout the bloodstream.",How Long Are Puppies With Parvo Contagious?,"Puppies and adult dogs with parvo start shedding the virus within 4-to-5 days of exposure. Unfortunately for conscientious owners, this time period does not always coincide with the first parvo symptoms, which means dogs can be contagious before owners even realize that they are sick. Puppies with parvo continue to shed the virus for up to 10 days after a clinical recovery, so be sure to keep any puppies recovering from parvo away from unvaccinated and partially vaccinated dogs.

Outside of your dog, the virus can survive indoors for at least one month, and outdoors it can survive for many months and even a year under the right conditions. Use a cleaner proven to kill parvovirus. Talk to your vet about the best way to remove the parvovirus from your home environment or kennels.",Symptoms of Parvo in Puppies,"A puppy with parvo is a very sick dog. The sooner you catch the early signs of the virus in puppies, the sooner you can get your dog to the vet. Since parvo is common in young puppies, you should call your vet any time your puppy is feeling under the weather, but you should also be aware of the specific symptoms of parvo in puppies:

• Bloody diarrhea

• Vomiting

• Fever

• Lethargy

• Anorexia

• Weight loss

• Weakness

• Dehydration

• Depression

All of these symptoms are serious by themselves and could be a sign of parvo or another serious illness. You should contact your vet immediately if you suspect your puppy has parvo, and be sure to notify the vet’s staff ahead of time of your suspicions and your puppy’s symptoms, so that they can take the appropriate quarantine procedures to prevent your puppy from infecting other dogs.",Treating Parvo in Puppies,"Your vet will diagnose parvo based on clinical signs and through blood work. She may also run a test called an ELISA to search for virus antigens in your dog’s feces and will perform additional diagnostic testing as needed.

There is no cure for parvo. Your vet will offer your puppy supportive care over the course of the illness, treating symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, and making sure that your puppy gets adequate nutrition.

Serious viruses like parvo weaken a puppy’s immune system and lower his white blood cell count, reducing his ability to fight off secondary bacterial infections. The damage the virus does to a dog’s intestinal wall increases the likelihood of a secondary infection. Your vet may put your puppy on an antibiotic medication to combat these bacterial infections and will monitor your puppy carefully for additional complications.

Parvo is a potentially fatal disease. The survival rate of dogs treated by a veterinarian is 68 to 92 percent, and most puppies that survive the first three-to-four days make a complete recovery. Recovery times vary depending on the severity of the case, but it usually takes approximately one week for puppies to recover from parvo.

Your veterinarian will walk you through the appropriate treatment steps for your puppy’s case and will advise you about any precautionary steps you need to take for any other puppies and dogs in your household."
what is a hush puppy,History of Hushpuppies,"Hushpuppies are finger-shaped dumplings of cornmeal that are deep-fried and traditionally served with fried catfish.  Also know as corn dodgers, they are especially popular throughout the South.  There are several interesting stories of the origins of hushpuppies:

The oldest story is that hushpuppies originated in the settlement of Nouvell Orleans (later called New Orleans, Louisiana), shortly after 1727.  They were created by a group of Ursuline nuns who had come from France.  The nuns converted cornmeal into a delicious food that they named croquettes de maise.  The making of these croquettes spread rapidly through the southern states.

An African cook in Atlanta is said to have given the name hushpuppy to this food.  When frying a batch of catfish and croquettes, a nearby puppy began to howl.  To keep the  puppy quiet, she gave it a plateful of the croquettes and said, “hush, puppy.”  Since the name was cut, it stuck.  This same story is also attributed to a Creole cook.

Hunters and trappers could be on the trail for days at a time.  At suppertime the hunting dogs would get hungry, so the hunters would mix a batter out of  cornmeal or flour and cook it in grease on the campfire.  Then they would throw the fried dough to the pups, telling them to be quiet, shut up, or “hush.”

Confederate soldiers would sit beside a campfire preparing their meals.  If they detected Yankee soldiers approaching, they would toss their yapping dogs some of the fried cornmeal cakes with the command “Hush, puppies!”

In the South, the Salamander was often known as a “water dog” or “water puppy.”  These were deep-fried with cornmeal and formed into sticks.  It is said they were called hushpuppies because eating such lowly food was not something a southern wife would want known to her neighbors.",How to Make Hush Puppies,"With a handful of ingredients and a few simple steps, you can serve up a batch of freshly made hush puppies with dinner.

Ingredients

• 1 cup yellow cornmeal

• 1/4 cup all-purpose flour

• 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder

• 1/2 teaspoon salt

• 1 large egg, lightly beaten

• 3/4 cup whole milk

• 1 small onion, finely chopped

• Oil for deep-fat frying

Step 1: Make the dough

Our version probably has more ingredients than the original cookout invention, but it’s worth the extra effort. In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. Whisk the egg, milk and onion; add to dry ingredients just until combined.

Step 2: Fry the batter

In a large cast-iron or electric skillet, heat oil to 365°. Drop batter by tablespoonfuls into oil. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 2-1/2 minutes. (Make sure you avoid these frying mistakes.) Drain on paper towels. Serve warm, with fried fish or barbecue!",  The Coziest Winter Nail Colors for January 2022,"The beginning of a new year often has us all feeling like starting off fresh by taking on better habits, getting rid of old ones, and—most commonly—changing up our look. While others are hitting the squats and going into the salon for a pixie cut, why not start slow and steady with a cozy winter manicure in a color that feels new to you? It takes only a little courage to step outside your usual OPI Lincoln Park After Dark or Essie Bordeaux, which is all you need to kick 2022 off on a fanciful foot.  From new wintry takes on classic dark nail colors to unique pops of color that'll have you feeling the opposite of boring, these are the best nail colors to try this January and tick off all the way into spring.",Pro Tips for Making the Best Hush Puppies,"Refrigerating the dough is critical. It won’t hold its shape well if you drop it into the oil at room temperature. One hour is the minimum, but I’ve made my batter up to 24 hours ahead and kept it chilled until I was ready to make them.

Pan-frying without using an actual fryer can be tricky. I do recommend using a thermometer to make sure you have the correct temperature, but even beyond that, using the right oil. Oils have different smoke points, points at which they begin to burn. For frying, you want to use an oil that has a high smoke point. For hush puppies, I like to use peanut or canola oil.

Frying at the right temperature is also important, but can be improvised easier. Too hot will cook the outside, but not the inside. Too cool and it starts to lose its shape. Oil temperatures will also change radically when you put the cold dough in, much like putting ice cubes in boiling water, it takes a minute or so to bounce back to the original temperature.",What do you dip Hush Puppies in,"Dipping sauces are also controversial. Hush puppy enthusiasts would argue that a good hush puppy needs no sauce and while they are correct, I am a woman who loves sauce! Tartar sauce seems the most traditional, but you can also use a Chipotle Aioli for a little zing or Yum Yum Sauce, a reader favorite from Japanese Steakhouses.

how long is a dog a puppy,The socialization stage: Three to twelve weeks,"• A puppy needs occasions to meet other pets and people during this stage.• By three to five weeks, play becomes important as a puppy becomes aware of his or her surroundings, companions (both people and dogs), and relationships.• The influence of the puppy’s littermates increases at four to six weeks as he or she learns more about being a dog.• From four to twelve weeks, a puppy’s interaction with people becomes more influential. With littermates, the puppy learns to play, develops social skills, learns the inhibited bite, explores his or her social boundaries and hierarchy, and improves physical coordination.• By five to seven weeks, a puppy needs positive human interaction as he or she develops curiosity and explores new experiences.• A puppy has full use of his or her senses by seven to nine weeks. A puppy is refining his or her coordination and physical ability, and can begin to be housetrained.• At eight to ten weeks, a puppy can experience real fear involving everyday objects and experiences. During this stage, a puppy needs support and positive reinforcement.• Enhancing responses, advancing social skills with littermates (proper contact), and investigating the surroundings and items takes place from nine to twelve weeks. This is a good time to begin elementary training as a puppy will begin to focus on people.",Sexual and physical maturity for dogs,"Most dogs reach sexual maturity around six months old. Sexual maturity is the physical stage at which a dog can physically sire or give birth to puppies. Having puppies may sound very adult, but if you’ve ever spent time around a six-month-old puppy, you’ll know that they’re not fully grown up.

Similarly, a puppy can be physically mature before they’re fully adult. Physical maturity is when your puppy reaches their adult height, which depends on breed. In general, small breeds are fully grown around 12 months of age, while larger breeds can take between one to two years to finish growing.

In fact, if you’ve raised a puppy, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of having a physically mature pet that doesn’t quite know how to control their body.

“The zoomies” are a whole new experience when your puppy weighs 50 pounds.",Emotional maturity for dogs,"Emotional maturity, on the other hand, is when a dog acts like a dog instead of a puppy. As with every other aspect of puppy development, the process of becoming emotionally mature takes place over time. You may not see it happening, but one day you’ll realize that your puppy has become a dog.

Emotional maturity coincides with your puppy’s hormonal surges evening out. As puppies grow and become sexually mature, they may act out, test boundaries, and “get in trouble.” But somewhere between one to one and a half years, your puppy will settle down, and their adult personality will emerge.

Puppies mature at their own rate, so it’s hard to identify the specific moment a puppy becomes an adult. As your puppy grows, watch them for these signs of emotional maturity:

• Listens and responds appropriately to training

• Settles down more readily

• “Listens” and responds to social cues from other dogs

Sometimes, the answer to the question “when is a puppy no longer a puppy” is simply, “when you can tell they’re an adult.” It depends on your particular puppy, and may take place over time.",How do you know a dog’s age?,"If your dog came from a shelter, you may not know exactly when it was born. Wondering how to tell if your new puppy is actually a puppy?

Younger dogs tend to be more active and energetic. As they age, dogs slow down. But even an older adult dog can have puppy-like bursts of energy! The best way to know your dog’s age is to observe physical signs of aging.

Start by looking at their teeth. If your new pup has shiny white teeth that look a bit small for their jaw, they may be under 16 weeks of age. By the time they’re adults, dogs have full mouths of permanent teeth. Click here for more on how to age a dog by looking at their teeth.

Other physical signs of aging include:

• Graying around the muzzle

• Cloudy or pale eye color

• Lower energy or lameness

For dogs straddling the line between puppy- and adulthood, it can be hard to guess their precise age. You can always ask your veterinarian to assess your dog’s age.",He's Lost His Puppy Teeth,"According to Dr. Margaret Gruen, clinical assistant professor at NC State Veterinary Medicine School, the majority of a dog’s adult teeth will be in place by about six months of age. This is a good time for pet owners to start thinking about dental care.

“Brushing dogs’ teeth is a great idea, and starting when their adult teeth have come in can help them to be comfortable with the procedure,” she says. Gruen suggests starting small, with short and positive sessions to get the dog used to the process.

“Finger brushes can be used for young dogs, and aim to brush the outside surface of the teeth at least three times per week,” she says. The Nylabone Advanced Oral Care dog finger brush is a great dog grooming tool for introducing your pup to dental care.

You may also introduce dog dental treats, like Dr. Lyon’s grain-free small dental dog treats, as a part of your dog’s dental routine.

With their new adult teeth, adolescent puppies will be able to handle slightly firmer dog toys, although Gruen recommends not giving anything too hard, as it can initiate dental wear."
how much water should a puppy drink,Your Puppy’s Water Intake During Housetraining,"The water rules change a bit during house-training. It’s best to remove your puppy’s water bowl at night. Be consistent with the time you remove water, the same way you’re consistent with feeding times. As a rule of thumb, remove the food and water bowls about two-to-three hours before bedtime. So, if your lights-out time is at 11 p.m., a puppy should have no food or water after about 8–8:30 p.m. This gives you a chance to take him out for a one last potty break before settling in for the night.

It’s important not to take this advice too far by restricting your pup’s water during the day. Puppies are more prone to dehydration than adult dogs because of their greater need for water. Restricting water intake can also lead to obsessive behavior like resource guarding. So, even while housetraining, you should give your puppy his regular amount of water during the day.",Canine Dehydration,"Most dogs, even puppies, naturally self-regulate when it comes to drinking water. But there are cases when your puppy may not drink enough and risk dehydration. There are several things that can cause dehydration, including vomiting, fever, excessive urination, or diarrhea. If your puppy eats mostly dry food, he also may not be getting enough water. And some dogs just don’t seem very tempted by their bowl of fresh water. Aside from noticing any of the causes we listed, you can get a good idea of whether your puppy is drinking enough water by monitoring his water intake, using the water-to-body-weight calculation.

There are also a few tests you can do quickly to check for dehydration:

• Grab the scruff of your puppy’s neck gently, stretch it out, and then let go. The skin should snap right back into place. If it’s slow to snap back, your dog is dehydrated.

• Feel his gums. If they’re dry or sticky, he needs more water.

• Press your finger gently against his gums, which temporarily blocks the flow of blood. While you’re pressing his gums, the area turns white. When you release the pressure, the area should return to a healthy pink within two seconds. If it takes longer, your puppy is dehydrated. The gums of a normal dog refill immediately, and the gums of a dehydrated dog could take up to three seconds (or more) to refill.

If you notice that your puppy doesn’t seem to be drinking enough water, you can make some changes around the house to encourage him to drink:

• Make sure his water bowl is clean, and fill it with fresh water.

• Place his water bowl near his food, bed, or any place he likes to hang out in the house.

• Reward him with a treat and praise him when he takes a drink.

• Flavor his water with bone broth or chicken broth to make it more enticing.

• Offer him ice cubes. Some dogs love chewing on ice cubes, and this is another way to increase water intake.",Overhydration in Dogs,"Believe it or not, dogs can overhydrate, as well. Also called “water intoxication,” overhydration can be as dangerous as dehydration. It can be caused by drinking too much, and also by water the dog inadvertently takes in while swimming or playing in the water.

If you suspect that your dog is overhydrated or exhibiting any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian:

• Lethargy

• Nausea

• Loss of coordination

• Staggering

• Bloating

• Dilated pupils

• Excessive salivation

• Vomiting

• Pale gums

Also, puppies that drink more water than they usually do may have polydipsia, which could be a sign of underlying metabolic changes, such as kidney issues, infection of the uterus, diabetes, or Cushing’s disease. This is especially true if it’s paired with an increase in urination. Always check with your veterinarian if you have concerns about the puppy’s water intake.

Having a new puppy brings with it so many responsibilities. You have to decide what food to use, which toys are safe and fun, how to housetrain, how to teach a pup the house rules, and so much more. But monitoring water intake is just as important and should become a part of routine daily care. Proper hydration contributes to your puppy’s overall health and well-being.",Ideal water intake for a dog,"The ideal water intake for a dog depends on his size and activity level. Most experts agree that, on average, a dog should consume 1 ounce of fluid per pound of body weight each day. That means a 45-pound dog should take in approximately 5.5 cups of fluid every day. Lactating mothers and puppies need more, as do dogs who are extremely active or live in hot, humid climates.

Why puppies need more water

Water constitutes as much as 85% of a newborn puppy, a percentage that changes to 60% when they are grown. As puppies, they receive the hydration they need from their mother’s milk. After they are weaned and begin eating kibble, water becomes essential in helping them digest their food.

Water is important for a dog’s growth and muscle development. It’s also an important part of the overall metabolic process, which includes digestion, brain activity, blood flow, and breathing, as well as kidney and liver function.

And, since a dog cools himself by panting, drinking water is essential for replacing the moisture that evaporates from their tongues, nasal passages, and lungs during the process. A well-hydrated dog has a moist nose, which aids in his ability to smell.","

Young puppies who are transitioning from mother’s milk to solid food need 0.5 cup of water every two hours. Once they’ve been weaned, they should be drinking between 0.5 to 1 fluid ounce per pound of body weight each day.

One of the best ways to make sure your puppy is drinking enough water is to set up a schedule. Instead of leaving a water bowl out for him to drink at will, ration his intake. Every few hours, measure the appropriate amount of water into his drinking bowl and call your puppy. Encourage him to drink the water and, when he does, reward him with praise and a few minutes of playtime.

Most dogs learn to drink enough water all by themselves; however, it’s important to monitor them when they are first learning. Not enough water intake can cause dehydration, while drinking too much water can be just as dangerous."
how often do puppies poop,Times Per Day,"There are some basic rules of thumb about poop frequency. In general, a dog should move their bowels at least once a day. Many will go two or three times a day on the regular, but if you’re wondering how often do puppies poop, it’s closer to five times a day.

But if your dog is pooping more than that, don’t panic! As long as your dog’s stool is solid, of an even consistency, and doesn’t contain blood—that’s probably normal for them. In fact, young dogs like puppies, poop more than three times a day due to a high metabolism, a large intake of food, and squeaky clean intestines.

If you find that your dog or puppy is pooping multiple times a day and their poop is runny, unformed, or contains blood, keep an eye on things and check in with your vet if the issue is not resolving within 48 hours.",How Often Do Puppies Poop: Potty Training,"Whether pooping or peeing, expect to take your puppy out frequently. In fact, you will start your day, end the evening, and go out often in between, for potty breaks in the beginning.

And while taking your pup out after waking up and before going to bed is pretty standard, what about those in between times? When they’re quite young, going outside for a potty break is good to plan for after meals, naps, playtimes, and before you head out.

It’s important to develop a schedule when you start to potty train, and to reward your puppy when they go outside, so that they connect waiting with something positive for doing their business in the correct place. It can also be helpful to return to the same outdoor spot to develop routine. Additionally, you may also want to consider crate training your puppy as they learn to get the hang of bathroom etiquette.",Time of Day,"As mentioned above, whether your puppy is going number one or number two, you’ll both be going outside often during the day. As a general rule of thumb, up until they’re 8 months old puppies can hold their urine about one hour per month of age plus one. So, a 3-month-old puppy can go four hours before they’ll really need a pee break.

However, for adults, you could set a clock by the regularity of some dog’s bowels. In general, expect that they will need to poop 8-12 hours after digesting their previous meal. For many dogs, that works out to be mornings and evenings. The truth is, though, that every dog poops a little differently. Whatever time of day they regularly go is what’s normal for them.

If your dog is slow to get down to business, try taking them for a walk. Most dogs poop more easily on a walk because exercise makes food move faster through the large intestine. You could also attempt to encourage their bowel movements by pairing them with a cue like “Go poop!”

Just like humans, it’s not unusual for your dog to occasionally have to poop at random or unexpected times. This may be stress-related or it may simply come down to how much food they got at their last meal (yeah, we saw you slip your pup a table scrap or two at dinner!). If your dog has eaten more food than normal, or foods that are not part of their regular diet, expect that they’ll need an extra walk to take care of business.",How can you tell when your puppy needs to poop?,"Typically, your puppy will need to relieve themselves around 30 minutes after having a meal. There is a vague rule of thumb that your puppy can hold it one hour per month of age until they reach 8 months old.

That is a fair assessment, but it doesn’t account for whether they will hold it in that long. They won’t if they don’t need to, so be ready to take your puppy outside within 30 minutes of them eating.

You can definitely bet that your puppy will need the bathroom first thing in the morning and before they go to bed too. Work these bathroom breaks into your routine.

When housetraining your puppy, there are a few telltale signs to watch out for:

Whining

Your clever pup will likely be the first to tell you they need to go with their words. Howling and whining by the backdoor, or just around the house is a clear sign they want your attention.

It’s not uncommon for puppies to do this when they need to relieve themselves so pay attention to their cries.

Restlessness and/or pacing

Your puppy will wonder around the house distracted and slightly agitated to try and find the perfect place to poop. This is likely to be paired with sniffing the ground a lot too.

If they are starting to understand that the backdoor is a portal to the outside world, they may pace around the door.

Circling

If your puppy is circling, you need to take action!

They have found a place to lay their poop, and if it so happens to be on your favorite antique rug, you’ll need to move them immediately.

You can couple this action with a “no” or “nah-ah” so they understand what they are doing wrong here.

Squatting

Oh dear, you weren’t fast enough! They have assumed the position and are ready to take aim. Scoop them up as fast as you can and place them outside to save that rug!","My puppy’s poop is green, yellow, black, red, or white","Color changes can be the most alarming. Any huge change in color should be treated with a certain level of seriousness – particularly if there is no direct correlation you can think of. For example, grass-eating can make green poop.

That’s not a scary or abnormal thing.

On the other hand, black, tarry poop is cause for alarm, so be sure to contact your veterinarian straight away.

Puppies poop a lot, and your puppy should poop many times during the day. I remember when Claude was a pup, and it was constant pooping… like a never ending torrent of the stuff.

Whilst all puppies will poop at multiple times during the day, it will eventually slow down, I promise!

when do puppies get shots,Puppy shots don’t last for life!,"When a puppy is finished with their initial “puppy shot” series, they’re not completely done with vaccines. Booster vaccinations will be needed throughout your dog’s life. The frequency and types of vaccine boosters your dog will need throughout their life is influenced by their “lifestyle,” where you live and travel to with them, how common certain diseases are in your area and at different times of year, and a host of other factors.

For some dogs and for some conditions, titers (blood tests measuring the level of antibodies in your dog's system) may help to determine vaccination intervals and may be preferable. This is a discussion to have with your vet.

Why are ""puppy shots"" a series? Why is the timing important?

Every puppy is different. A puppy who was one in a litter of 3 puppies may have been able to suckle more colostrum (the antibody-rich “first milk”) from Mom, than a puppy that was one in a litter of 13.

Although if the Mom of the litter of 3 wasn’t well vaccinated herself, or she didn’t produce good milk or do a good job of nursing her pups, then it may not necessarily be the case.

Similarly, some puppies are born with deficiencies in their immune system, or their immune system may develop more slowly because of dietary or other factors. So we never 100% know a pup’s starting immune status, how well they are initially protected by “maternal immunity,” or how well their immune system will respond to the vaccines we're administering.

So to provide the best level of protection to the greatest number of puppies in the greatest number of situations, the “puppy shots” are administered as a series of ""initial shots"" and ""booster shots"" over the course of the first several months of their life. This gives their maternal immunity (which is protective but can interfere with a puppy's vaccinations) time to wane while their own immune system is fully developing in response to and conjunction with their ""shots.""",What Vaccines Do Dogs Need?,"The concept of core versus non-core vaccines

""CORE"" vaccines: Some infectious diseases of dogs are so common, debilitating and devastating, easily spread, and/or are able to be spread to people (zoonotic) that their vaccination against them are deemed of critical importance for all dogs, regardless of their geographic location, lifestyle, etc. These include Distemper, Parvo, Canine Infectious Hepatitis, and Rabies. The vaccines protecting against these conditions are known as the “core” vaccines. The first three are often administered as the combination DA2P shot.

""NON-CORE"" vaccines: On the other hand, there are diseases/conditions for which there are vaccines, but either because of their limited geographic distribution (meaning they don't affect all parts of the country equally), lesser severity, specific lifestyle risk factors, or other reasons, they are not automatically always recommended for every dog. These typically include Lepto, Lyme disease, Influenza (“Dog Flu”), Kennel Cough, and Parainfluenza. The vaccines that protect against these diseases are called the “non-core” vaccines. While they’re not necessarily needed by all dogs, they can be extremely beneficial to many dogs and in many situations.

Not typically recommended: Then there are the vaccines that just don’t work very well, are associated with more severe side effects, or the diseases they protect against just typically aren't severe enough to be recommended for use in general.",Vaccinatable Conditions of Dogs,"The core vs. non-core category of each vaccine is provided below for guidance, but the situation can be different for every dog and every situation. Your veterinarian is your best resource for helping to determine which vaccines your new pup would benefit from, and when. They are the only ones who have the medical training and understanding, as well as the first-hand knowledge of your dog and home/environmental situation necessary to best guide you.

Not all vaccines can completely prevent infection and disease, but even if they don’t completely prevent infection, they will at least minimize the effects of infection and often shorten the course of the infection.

Note that some of the vaccinatable conditions of dogs listed below can be zoonotic, meaning that they can also infect and cause disease in people.

Lyme disease (Borrelia)

Non-CoreCause: BacteriaThese bacteria can be transmitted through the bite of an infected tick.Signs:

• 

Lameness (limping) that can affect multiple legs at once or in succession

Some dogs will also have swollen lymph nodes

It can cause painful arthritis

In cases where the kidneys are affected, signs may also include sudden loss of appetite and energy, onset of vomiting, increased thirst and urinations (progressing to decreased thirst and urinations), and weight loss.",What Puppies Need to Be Protected,"DHPP Vaccination

The most important vaccination for puppies is the DHPP vaccination. Your puppy needs to receive the DHPP vaccination at least twice but preferably 3 times to be considered protected.

Deworm & Heartworm Preventative

Along with their puppy shots, puppies also need deworming and heartworm preventative. Puppies get parasites from their mother, either through their milk or even in utero. Those worms need to be treated with several doses to ensure that all the parasites are killed off.

Bordetella

Bordetella is an extremely contagious disease that causes flu or cold-like symptoms in dogs. It’s usually not deadly, but it can be a threat to vulnerable puppies.

The bordetella vaccination that we give does not need a booster, but we may recommend boostering if you received previous vaccinations from another veterinarian.

Leptospirosis

Leptospirosis or lepto is a deadly disease. It’s uncommon, but can easily kill puppies, especially if they’re in at-risk areas. This vaccine is not completely effective the first time we give it, so we recommend giving it again one month after the first vaccination. After the first booster, we recommend it yearly.

Rabies

Puppies must be at least 3 months old to get a rabies vaccination, but we usually recommend giving it to them with their last round of puppy shots (since it doesn’t need to be boostered, and will finish off your puppy’s vaccinations).

Texas law requires puppies receive a Rabies shot by 4 months of age.",My puppy is over 2 months. Where should I start with their vaccinations?,"If your puppy has already passed two months, then it’s best to figure out what vaccinations you need based off of your current situation and your puppy’s current age.

Most of the time, it’s fine to start with whichever round of puppy shots would normally be given at their age.

For example, for a 3 month old puppy, we would start with the Puppy #2 package (DHPP, deworm, Bordetella, Leptospirosis & Heartworm preventative). Next month, they would get the Puppy #3 package (Rabies, DHPP, Lepto, deworm), then at 5 months they get a final DHPP vaccination or the Puppy #1 package.

If your puppy is 4 months, we can start with the last round of puppy vaccinations, then just work backwards to make sure your puppy gets the right booster shots.

For older puppies, just remember that the priority is the DHPP vaccination and the Rabies vaccination – the first because it’s what puppies die from the most, and the second because it’s required by law.

how to get your puppy to stop biting,What Is Bite Inhibition?,"Bite inhibition is a behavior puppies usually learn from their parents, littermates, and other puppies that teaches them the strength of their own bite. When a puppy bites too hard, their unsuspecting victim lets out a loud, high-pitched yelp to startle the puppy and let them know it hurts. As a result, they learn to use a lighter, more moderate force when biting during play.

In some scenarios, biting can occur as an involuntarily reflex, like when dogs are anxious (maybe at the vet), in pain, or just plain old don’t like something (like those evil baths you give them.) Kind of like how some of us have a natural reflex to aggressively start swatting everything in sight when we see a spider. Reflex or no, it’s important for dogs to learn not to use their full bite force on you or other animals.",How To Teach Your Puppy Bite Inhibition,"No, do not bite back. At best, you’re going to end up with a mouth full of fur, at worst you’re going to hurt them and teach them to be afraid of you.

• Step 1: When your puppy bites you too hard during play, calmly let out a high-pitched “OW!” or “OUCH!” sound. Try not to start laughing at your own silly noises or your pup will still think you’re playing.• Step 2: Your exclamations should startle them enough to stop playing, but be sure to immediately pause any play for a few seconds until your puppy calms down a little bit. • Step 3: Praise them with a “good boy” or “good girl” once they calm down, and continue play.• Step 4: Repeat these steps no more than 3–4 times in 15 minutes. If your puppy isn’t startled by your high-pitched noises and fantastic acting skills, or actually becomes more rambunctious when hearing them, skip down to the next section.• Step 5: Once your puppy starts to get the hang of controlling their really hard bites, you can work toward encouraging them to be even gentler. Make your “OW!” noises with moderately hard bites, and then move on to lighter bites.• Step 6: Continue with these steps until your puppy is able to play by mouthing you with no pressure at all. Biting is normal for puppies and part of their learning process, so be patient! Sometimes eliminating these “bites” entirely can take up to 6 months.",What To Do If Your Puppy Still Bites Hard After Yelling “OUCH!”,"Some puppies don’t react at all to the high-pitched “ouch” method, and some may even get more worked up when you try this. So now what do you do?

• Step 1: When your puppy bites too hard, either silently or paired with your high-pitched “ouch” noise, stop playing by calmly turning around and tucking your hands up under your armpits for 15-30 seconds (this removes the temptation of delicious dangling fingers).• Another option is to gently put them in their crate for a minute or so to calm down. Never yell at or hit your puppy during this process, or they may become fearful of being handled. On the complete opposite spectrum, they may also learn that biting gets a reaction out of you, which can lead to more biting.• Step 2: Always praise or reward them once they calm down.• Step 3: When they’ve calmed, continue play. It’s important to teach puppies that play stops when they bite, and continues when they’re calm.",Stop Playing Once the Biting Begins,"While playing together, puppies chase, wrestle, pounce and nip each other. When one bites another too hard, the victim will yelp and stop playing for a few seconds. This behavior teaches puppies bite inhibition, knowing if they’re too rough, they’ll lose their playmate. You can offer a puppy the same lesson he’d learn from his littermates.

Once your puppy bites, end playtime right away. You might let out a high-pitched yelp or “Ow!” to show your puppy he’s caused you pain. Instead of jerking your hand or foot away, try to make it go limp, which will be unexciting for your puppy. Jerking motions can activate the puppy’s chase instincts, which may cause more biting. Then, turn around and tuck your hands into your armpits, giving your puppy a playtime time-out. Even a negative reaction is a response — refuse to give your puppy attention after biting. Ignore your puppy for 10 to 20 seconds, then resume playing. Yelp and stop playtime for softer and softer bites until your puppy learns to play gently. If biting continues, take a break from playing.

Even if a bite catches you off-guard and hurts you, always skip negative reinforcement. Never hit, hurt or yell at your dog — physical punishments can make a dog fearful and likelier to be aggressive. Steer clear of any discipline that might make your puppy afraid of you, as this can develop into long-lasting fear aggression. Instead, naughty behavior should receive no attention at all.",Distract Them With Something They Can Chew On,"Puppies need to teethe, but not on your fingers or toes. When your puppy starts nipping, offer a toy instead. You’ll teach your puppy toys are OK to bite, but your skin is not. If your puppy continues trying to bite you, turn away and pause playtime. You can incorporate toys into your play — use a toy for tug-of-war with your puppy. Have it nearby during playtime and take it out when your puppy gets nippy. Try to keep tugging from becoming too aggressive.

Having toys on hand creates an ideal opportunity to teach your puppy “let go” or “leave it” commands. When a puppy has a toy in his mouth, hold a treat nearby and say “drop it,” “let go” or “leave it.” Be gentle, but precise with your words. When he drops the toy, offer him the treat along with some praise. Eventually, this will teach your puppy to give you objects without getting defensive."
how to get puppies to stop biting,Tips for playing with your puppy,"As a pet parent, you set the tone for each playtime. This also applies to aggressive playing that could indicate to your pup that it’s fun until someone is hurt, like a child.

All family members need to understand that consistent, non-aggressive play is what a puppy needs to learn so that he will not accidentally bite or nip someone unexpectedly.

Some tips for playing together include:

• Playtimes must be initiated by human family members, not a puppy.

• Never rough-house with a puppy, that’s not what you want him to learn.

• Always have toys readily available to offer him instead of a hand or finger.

• To stop puppy biting, yelp out loud, withdraw attention for a few seconds.

• Have a consistent daily schedule for your puppy that includes giving him attention, time to explore, and exercise.

• Play chase and retrieve or tug-o-war games with different toys.

• Redirect puppy energy by taking him on age-appropriate walks.

• Ensure that all family members use the same 11 step plan to teach a puppy not to bite or nip.

• Monitor puppy playtimes with children and teach them not to provoke a puppy through close head-to-head contact.",Do:,"• Snuggle and pet your puppy when it’s relaxed or sleepy. Your hands are exciting teeth targets when they’re close to the puppy’s mouth, so putting them nearby when your puppy has less energy to bite reinforces the idea that getting petted is not an opportunity for nibbling.

• Have toys handy so that you can redirect biting behavior when you’re playing with your puppy. If you’re sitting down with the puppy and it gets overly excited, stand up and end the game. Reward good behavior, such as sitting, with a treat or another chance to play.

• Keep your puppy entertained. Teach games such as low-key fetch or hide and seek with toys.

• Have treats handy to reward good behavior. Teaching your puppy to sit and stay in a certain spot (such as on a mat or dog bed) while you walk by is a handy behavior to use. You can toss a treat or kibble on your puppy’s “spot” to make it a good place to be and reward the puppy with another treat when it visits and stays in that spot.

• Keep track of the times of day when your puppy is more likely to be bitey.

• Use a crate and/or baby gates to create safe play areas. If your puppy doesn’t have access to yummy chair legs in the first place, then you don’t need to worry about teaching it to leave the furniture alone.

• Every two or three days, rotate the toys that your puppy can access. This helps to prevent the toys from becoming boring.

• Make sure your puppy gets regular naps. Growing puppies need lots of rest, and a tired puppy is more likely to bite.

• Prevent your puppy from having the opportunity to bite, indoors and out. If your puppy is wildly biting at you or the leash when you’re out on a walk, straighten your arm and hold the puppy out away from you (make sure all four paws are on the ground) until it calms down. In the house, you can let your supervised puppy drag a light, long leash around, and if biting starts to happen, you can step on the lead until it stops.",Don’t:,"• Touch your puppy on the head. Puppies invite play with other puppies by biting at faces, so petting your puppy on the head is a signal to bite and play. Scratch your puppy on the chin or chest instead.

• Wrestle with your puppy. Wrestling invites biting and rough play. In addition, your puppy needs to accept handling of all different body parts for grooming and veterinary exams. Wrestling will make it more difficult for your puppy to stay calm while being examined or groomed.

• Shove or wiggle toys in your puppy’s face. Wiggle a toy along the ground instead.

• Use punishment-based techniques (holding the puppy’s jaw, holding the mouth shut, etc.). The fallout from these techniques can make a puppy hand-shy.

• Use repetitive verbal cues (“no,” “no bite,” “ouch,” etc.). If you’re repeating your cues, they’re not working, and that will teach your puppy that your words have no meaning. On top of that, if your puppy is biting for attention, giving verbal recognition will actually reward that behavior.",Additional Tips,"Is your puppy getting enough mental stimulation? Try exposing your puppy to something new, teaching a new trick or game, or feeding meals in a KONG or other food-dispensing toy. Anything that encourages your puppy to use its brain will help use up that puppy energy and make it easier for you to manage.

Be prepared for your puppy’s behavior and plan ahead. Reward the puppy with treats, praise or play when things are going well, and do your best to remove objects and opportunities to bite. When you know you’re going to be busy with other parts of life, having a crate or an enclosed “puppy-proof” area and a prepared KONG or two filled with kibble, small amounts of peanut butter, biscuits or other food (freezing the stuffed KONG helps the filling last longer) will ensure that when you just don’t have time to deal with puppy biting, there’s a safe place for your puppy to go and amuse itself while you do other things.

As with all dog training, consistency is key. You may need to try different techniques to see what works best for you and your puppy, but don’t give up when the puppy’s behavior doesn’t change overnight. Your puppy is learning and growing, and keeping your behavior consistent will help your dog to be consistent as well. Make sure every member of your family is on the same page! With time and patience, your puppy will learn to use its teeth in ways that make both of you happy.",Stop a Puppy From Mouthing People’s Hands and Chewing Clothes,"Is your puppy biting your hands, your legs, your clothes and your shoes? Does your dog start mouthing and biting during play? Learn how to stop nipping in puppies.

Dogs explore the world with their mouth, particularly during puppyhood. Much like a two-year- old human child explores the world with his hands, a puppy explores the world with his mouth.

But what happens when a puppy starts biting and nipping a bit too much? Some teething behaviors are normal, but what happens when a dog starts biting people during play or as an attention-getting behavior? Fortunately, there are certain training techniques that dog owners can use to help a puppy stop biting, nipping, gnawing and chewing on people, leashes, clothing, and shoes."

Puppy FAQ

Q. When do puppies become adults?

A. Puppies attain adulthood at various ages depending on the breed and size of the animal. However, they typically become adult dogs between their first and second birthday.

Q. Which is easier to train, puppies or adult dogs?

A. Both puppies and adult dogs can be successfully trained. However, puppies haven’t developed any bad habits yet, so training a puppy is often easier than training an adult animal.

Q. Do I have to have a puppy to celebrate National Puppy Day?

A. No. Anyone who is a dog lover can celebrate the day.",Ways To Celebrate National Puppy Day,"Even if you can’t adopt a puppy, there are still many ways you can help puppies—on Puppy Day or any day!

Be A Virtual Volunteer

Spring is a time when animal shelters are especially in need of volunteers, as they tend to see an increase in the amount of puppies during this time. And volunteering doesn’t have to be an in-person event. You might not be able to play with the puppies, but you will still be helping them.

For example, if your local shelter is cutting back on volunteer hours and public admissions, there are things you can do from home, like spread the word on social media. Share infographics that encourage spay and neuter programs, as well as pictures and stories of new puppies up for adoption.

If you’re an accounting whiz or have other business expertise and you’re willing to donate your time, contact your local shelter and ask what you can do to help from home. Start by filling out an online application on their web site (don’t show up unannounced).

Be A Foster Mom or Dad

If you can’t adopt a puppy right now, but can open your home to a pet in need temporarily, fostering is a good option. It’s not only rewarding, but it helps shelters free up space for other dogs. Fostering allows you to get some fun one-on-one time with puppies while teaching them socialization, potty training, and basic commands. A puppy that’s mastered these basic skills is more likely to be adopted. Contact your local shelter about how to get started fostering.

Donate

Many shelters have put an end to donations of blankets and sheets for the time being, but they’re always looking for canned food, bagged dry food, unused toys, bowls, and other supplies. Or consider starting a supply drive: ask your local shelter what they most need, and then email friends and neighbors to see if they’ve got extra canned food they can leave on doorsteps in bags. When things return to normal, a neighborhood supply drive is a fun way for kids to get involved helping animals."
how big will my puppy get calculator,Factors that Influence a Puppy’s Weight,"As you can imagine, many factors can influence a dog’s weight. Some are genetic and others are environmental.

First, as we mentioned, you can look at your puppy’s parents for a clue. While it’s not a surefire method, if both parents are approximately the same size and weight, there’s a good chance that your pup will grow up to be about the same size. Many times, of course, you won’t be able to see both parents (or even one parent), so this makes it more of a guessing game. Even if the puppy’s mother is, say, 30 lbs, that doesn’t mean that his father wasn’t 20 lbs or 50 lbs.

Sex can also make a difference when it comes to puppy weight. Male dogs of each breed tend to be larger and heavier than female dogs of the same breed. If you are getting a male puppy, then, it’s likely that if the father is the same breed, your pup will be a bit bigger than his mother. A female puppy might end up being the same size as her mother, assuming the father wasn’t much bigger.

While neutering won’t change overall puppy weight on its own, it can make the dog more likely to end up overweight if you don’t modify his diet. The reduction in sex hormones makes your puppy’s energy needs go down, so it’s often necessary to feed him less. You should not change his diet drastically without speaking to your veterinarian, though; keep in mind that if you have him neutered before he’s a year old, he’s still growing and needs more calories than an adult dog of the same size.

And on that note, diet and exercise will play a role in how much your puppy weighs once he’s an adult. Just like humans, dogs can become overweight or obese. And just like humans, there are serious health effects from obesity in dogs. So be sure to feed your dog a healthy diet and help him get the exercise he needs for good health.",How Big Will My Puppy Get? Average Weights for Various Breeds,"If you know your puppy’s breed (or breeds, in the case of a mixed-breed dog), you might be able to guess what his adult weight will be. The puppy calculator takes breed into consideration, but here are a few examples of what you might expect depending on the breed of your pup. Remember that where there is a range, the females will generally be on the smaller end and the males on the larger end, but there is a lot of overlap between individual dogs.

• Saint Bernards will often reach between 120 and 180 lbs. 15

• Mastiffs will generally be between 120 and 230 lbs. 16",How Fast Will My Puppy Gain Weight?,"The speed at which your puppy will reach his adult weight depends on his overall size. In general, toy and small breeds will grow more quickly than large and giant breeds. Toy breeds might reach their adult weight at as young as 8 months, while the largest of the giant breeds will continue growing until they are 2 or 3 years old. Small, medium, and large breeds will fall in line along that spectrum.

Using a puppy growth chart like these from the Waltham Petcare Science Institute can help you determine whether your pup is at the right weight for his breed and size. Keep in mind, however, that these weight charts are good as a rule of thumb but that there will be some individual variance. Your vet can help you decide whether your puppy is underweight, overweight, or just right.

As he becomes an adult, you can use the method where you feel his ribs. For most dogs, you should be able to easily feel his ribs without pressing inward; you should not see his ribs. Some breeds tend to be leaner or heavier, however, so again, this is something your veterinarian should help you determine.

If you want to guess at how much your puppy will weigh as an adult, you can double what he weighs or weighed at 4 months of age. This is a good estimate for medium and large dogs, but it doesn’t work well with very small or giant breeds, as they grow more quickly or slowly than average. It also can’t take into consideration the possibility that your dog may become overweight or obese. Still, it will give you a good ballpark estimate if you are curious.

As with everything else pertaining to your puppy, keep in mind that he is an individual. Even littermates might end up not weighing the same as adults, so keep an eye on how your pup is growing with the help of your veterinarian, who will see him several times over the course of his first year and then annually after that.

Unfortunately, carbohydrates are much cheaper an ingredient as compared to the other nutrients like protein. Hence, they are often used by major large dog food manufacturers to make up the weight of dog food whilst keeping the prices of the dog food low.

This is the main reason why pets all over the United States are getting obese. And, ironically, this became the driving forces behind the rise of these healthy pet food startups, as their founders seek to provide their own proper and much healthier alternatives.

when do puppies start teething,Puppy teething timeline,"The teething stage doesn’t last long, and before you know it, your puppy’s baby teeth are gone and your adult dog has a full set of new chompers.

• 2 to 4 weeks: Baby teeth come in. Puppies are still nursing at this point – their eyes are opening, and they’re beginning to explore the world beyond their mother.• 5 – 7 weeks: Baby teeth finish growing. Puppies will naturally nip each other and chew everything around them as part of an important stage of their development.• 12 – 16 weeks: Teething begins as baby teeth fall out. This process can take as long as a few months, though it depends on the individual dog.

Puppies typically have all of their permanent teeth by six months of age. All dog breeds have about 42 adult teeth in total – perfect for a lifetime of ball-catching, stick-chewing, and treat-chomping.",What can I give my puppy for teething pain?,"To help your pet during the teething process, offer them gentle chew toys. Dog toys like the KONG offer your puppy the chance to gnaw away without damaging your shoes or your furniture. (Though, let’s face it, your shoes, your couch, and your table legs might suffer during your puppy’s enthusiastic chewing period.)

Which chew toys are best for teething? As mentioned, KONGs are a classic choice for a reason. Fill them with peanut butter for an enticing treat. You can even freeze a stuffed KONG to add to the challenge and increase its gum-soothing effect. KONG now makes a puppy teething stick to alleviate discomfort, as well.

Safe chew toys won’t chip or splinter while your dog noms on them. That’s why rubber toys are a good fit. Nylabones for puppies are a popular choice, and they’re usually available at your local grocery store. You’ll find many ingenious chew toy options online and from specialty pet stores, as well.

Rope toys can be effective, but make sure your dog isn’t shredding them and swallowing bits of rope.

In addition to dog toys, chews like bully sticks can provide relief. Other popular options are naturally shed antlers, which are safer than bones. Never give your puppy any bones that might splinter, as this can lead to choking.

As with many puppy activities, chew time shouldn’t be solo time for your new pet. You don’t have to stare at them the whole time – hey, they’re cute! – but do keep an eye out. Puppies can sometimes hurt themselves with overenthusiastic chewing.",What food and treats can I give my puppy for teething?,"You can keep feeding your pup their regular diet. Feeding them treats or special healthy foods is also acceptable during teething.

One difference? You might consider adding soft dog food to your pup’s kibble if you’re not already feeding them any wet food. This will help their kibble go easy on your new puppy’s mouth.

Keep an eye on your new dog. If they yip with pain while eating – or avoid their food – that’s a sign that a change is in order. Always consult with your vet about any dietary changes, of course.

Frozen treats can be a tasty teething snack. Many pet parents swear by ice cubes. Many dogs enjoy chomping away on ice cubes, especially if they’re cubes of frozen chicken broth. Again, as with chews, supervise your pup while they’re enjoying their icy treat.",Chew toys for teething puppies ,"Look for toys made of a hard rubber material, such as Kongs, which you can also fill with something tasty, e.g.cheese spread. Have a selection of chew toys, and rotate them often. This will maintain their novelty and ensure that your puppy is interested in the chew toy you have provided rather than your TV remote or expensive shoes!

Cold chews can be very soothing and are something you can make at home to store in the freezer.  Ideas include:

Teething is a good time to start brushing your puppy’s teeth and get them into a good dental hygiene routine. It’s a good idea to brush your dog’s teeth every day to keep their teeth and mouth in a healthy condition. Be patient and take your time to make sure your puppy enjoys the experience and doesn’t become worried about their mouths being checked.

You can buy toothbrushes for dogs, or you could use a soft child’s brush. Make sure you use a toothpaste that is designed for dogs – not humans, which could give your dog an upset tummy.

You might want to use your finger to begin with – to get your puppy used to the feeling of having their teeth cleaned.

Keep in mind that chewing and biting may be something other than teething, such as mouthing. In the same way that children use their hands to explore their world, puppies use their mouths.  Make sure your puppy has plenty of appropriate things to chew on. Mouthing is quite common and normal in most young puppies and is rarely aggressive but they still need to learn to be gentle and not nip or bite.",Puppy Teething Stages By Age,"• Three weeks of age – a puppies baby teeth start coming through. The first baby teeth are the front incisors, followed by the canines. The canines are the pointed teeth next to the incisors. Then the premolars, which are on the side of each jaw.• A puppy will have a complete set of 28 razor-sharp baby teeth by six to eight weeks old. • Four months onward, a puppy will start, one by one, to lose their baby teeth and begin to replace them with adult teeth. This time they will include molars at the back as added extra teeth. • A dog should have a complete set of 42 adult teeth by eight months old.

how long to potty train a puppy,How long does it take to potty train a puppy by age?,"Just how long you can expect to work on potty training will depend on the age of your dog. A puppy that’s just two weeks old has a couple of months of training ahead of them. A ten month old puppy may be able to be potty trained in under a week! So, let’s talk about how age can help us answer the question, “how long does it take to potty train a puppy?”

Up to three months old. At this stage, your puppy can’t hold their bladder for more than about one to three hours. And, until they’ve had their vaccinations and received the go-ahead from their vet, going outside isn’t recommended. So, potty training during the first three months should focus on getting your dog on a consistent schedule, establishing cues, and teaching your puppy to use a pee pad.

Three to five months. The older your pup gets, the longer they’ll be able to hold their bladder. And, the quicker they’ll learn to associate going outside with a special reward. Still, it may not be until another few weeks or months until a puppy at this age is truly housebroken. You should expect a few accidents until your dog gets a little bit older.

Six months and older. By the time your pup is six months old, they should be able to get through pretty long stretches without going to the bathroom. If you’re able to focus on consistent potty training at this age, you can expect to be free of the puppy pads in a matter of days or weeks.

In the best case scenario, a puppy can be mostly house-trained by the time they’re about 6 months old.",Breed considerations,"Some dog breeds will whiz through potty training in no time. Others will take longer than the average three to six month time frame.

Small dogs, in particular, are harder to potty train because it can be difficult to contend with such a tiny bladder. And, there are some larger dog breeds whose independent spirit makes them less than engaged in the potty training process. That’s not to say that they can’t be potty trained! It will just take a bit longer to complete the process.

Here are a few breeds who typically take longer to be house trained:

DachshundPugBeaglePomeranianJack Russell TerrierAfghan HoundBasset Hound

So, how long does it take to potty train a puppy from the above dog breeds? It can be hard to put an exact number on it. While the average dog is fully potty trained around 6 months of age, a dog struggling with the transition may take a few extra weeks or months.",Still struggling with training? ,"If you’ve been working on potty training for a few weeks with no improvement, don’t worry. You’re not destined to use the potty pads forever. But, there are a few other reasons that could be behind your dog’s behaviour:

Separation anxiety. Some puppies who struggle with alone time will go potty in the house out of stress. If your pup tends to do their business when you’re not at home, while also engaging in chewing, howling or digging behaviours, they might need a solution to their separation anxiety before they can be fully house trained.

A medical condition. If your puppy’s frequent indoor accidents are concerning you, make sure to get your vet’s opinion. It’s possible that a bladder infection or other medical issue is behind their inability to learn potty training.","First, Understand Positive Reinforcement Training","Positive reinforcement is an effective and humane way to train your dog. It’s especially effective for puppy potty training.

Here’s how it works:

• You show your dog the behavior you want.• Your dog does that behavior.• You mark the specific behavior by saying “good dog!”, “yes!” or using a clicker.• You reward them immediately with an affectionate pet, treat, or praise.• Your dog learns which behaviors get rewarded and starts offering those behaviors more often.2

When you train your puppy, it’s up to you to show them exactly what good behavior looks like. With potty training, this means that you want to show them again and again that the bathroom is outside. Once they make that connection, they will start asking to go outside to potty.",When Should You Begin Potty Training Your Puppy?,"If possible, try to take some time off of work when you pick up your new puppy. You want to start potty training – or at least start introducing the concept – on day one. The more present you can be, the faster they will learn.

While puppies don’t have full control over their bladders until 16-20 weeks, you want to start showing them where to go as soon as they come home with you.3 The earlier a puppy starts to learn where they should go to the potty, the less likely they are to develop bad habits.

For both young puppies and older dogs, you want to be realistic about how long they can hold their bladders.4

Start the process gently, helping them get used to the crate if you plan to use one. Don’t force your puppy into a crate on day one – or ever for that matter. Take the time to introduce the crate slowly, and let your dog form positive associations with it before you use it.

You want your puppy to feel at home and comfortable with you. So while you should start “training” by gently showing them where to go and rewarding them when they do, refrain from any punishment or scolding– especially in the first couple of weeks.5"

The Benefits of Having a Sports Watch When Going for Your Exercises"
how long to feed puppy food,Puppy Food Has Nutrients Growing Dogs Need,"Puppy food has a lot of extra nutrients and protein that adult dog food may lack.1 A growing dog that’s building muscle and bone needs more nutrients and calories to maintain healthy development. Puppies, especially those of a larger breed, need the right amount of fatty acids, fiber, and protein, along with controlled amounts of calcium so bones grow at the proper rate. They also need certain omega-3 fatty acids for proper development.2 This is why puppies need food formulated for their nutritional needs, rather than adult dog food.

AvoDerm Natural dog food offers two formulas created especially for puppies. The canned Puppy Chicken & Rice Formula has chicken as the first ingredient to help any puppies with food sensitivities to other proteins. It’s also made with avocado, which is rich in antioxidants that can help promote a healthy immune system.

If you prefer dry kibble, AvoDerm Natural dog food offers a Puppy Chicken Meal & Brown Rice Formula. This has just the right balance of protein, fat, and nutrients that puppies need. It’s also corn- and wheat-free, which is great for puppies with more sensitive stomachs.",How do I know if I’m feeding my puppy enough?,"Watch their eating habits

As puppies enter new growth stages, their calorie needs will automatically adjust and you should see this showing up in their appetite levels.

If your once-ravenous four-bowl-a-day pupper is almost three months old but has lost momentum in the “clean bowl club,” their body may be ready to transition to three meals a day.

Keep treats in mind

Treats are another thing to consider when right-sizing your pup’s meals. If you’ve had a busy day of training, and you’ve doled out many treats and rewards, you’ll want to adjust the mealtime accordingly. Consider how many calories they’ve consumed, and put a little less in the bowl.

Keep an eye on their size and weight

The puppy pudge and potbelly should be gone by the time your young dog reaches one year old. At the same time, they shouldn’t look too skinny or underweight.

Generally speaking, you should see a dip between the stomach and hips if you’re looking at your puppy from the top down. It’s OK if their ribs are showing, you just don’t want their skin to look sunken between them. They should be lanky, not emaciated.",How many cups of food should I feed my puppy?,"The amount of food your puppy needs will depend on their age and weight. Small-breed puppies will have different calorie and mineral needs than large-breed puppies. To stay on track and in balance, here’s what you’ll need to do:

1. Follow the feeding directions on the bag

There’s no universal portion that will meet the needs of every pup. Whether you’ve opted for a puppy formula or an all-stages formula, follow the feeding directions provided by the brand to guide you. High-quality brands, like NutriSource, are dense in calories and nutrients, which means you’ll need to put around 30 to 40% less food in the bowl than you would, say, a supermarket brand. Using your puppy’s age and weight as a guide, you can adjust the portion as they grow.

2. Do regular weigh-ins

Every couple of weeks or so, have a quick weigh-in with your pup. This will help you see if your dog’s growth is on schedule — not too little, not too much. You don’t need any special equipment to weigh your dog. All you need is your bathroom scale.

How to weigh your puppy at home:

• First, weigh yourself.

• Then, pick up your puppy and step back onto the scale.

• Subtract your weight from the combined weight, and you’ll have your pupper’s metric.

3. Keep a calendar

It’s easy to lose track of time. To help you anticipate important changes in your puppy’s feeding schedule, mark their upcoming milestones in your calendar: three months, six months, one year and so forth.",How to transition from puppy formula to adult formula or all-life-stages (ALS) formula,"When that one-time ball of fluff is done growing, it’s time to transition to an adult formula. Sudden changes in food can be upsetting to a dog’s gastrointestinal system. For that reason, many brands recommend a phased approach, starting with a small ratio of adult food to puppy food, and gradually increasing that adult ratio.

However, if you’re feeding your puppy NutriSource brands from the start, the phased approach isn’t necessary. in particular NutriSource chicken and rice recipes transition exceptionally well from puppy to adult formulations.

If you’re feeding your dog a brand that does require a phased approach, here’s a basic formula to follow:

• Day 1: 80% puppy formula to 20% adult formula

• Day 3: 50-50 mix of puppy and adult formula

• Day 5: 20% puppy formula to 80% adult formula

• Day 7: 100% adult formula",What makes a food suitable for puppies?,"Puppies are constantly growing and require a diet that is formulated to meet their nutritional needs and supports proper growth and development. This includes appropriate amounts of fat, vitamins and minerals, energy-providing carbohydrates, and other nutrients. More nutritional elements significant to a puppy’s diet and growth include DHA to support brain development, antioxidants to promote a strong immune system, and high protein for lean muscles.

When choosing a food for your puppy, look for the following on the label:

• “Complete and balanced”• “All Life Stages”• (For large breed puppies) “including the growth of large breed dogs”

These statements indicate that the diet is suitable for puppies according to AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles.

Large breed puppies (defined as >70 lbs. fully grown) have extra nutritional needs that contribute to the appropriate and gradual growth of their larger skeletal framework.

When feeding your puppy, be sure to check feeding guidelines on the bag and consult with your veterinarian to make sure your puppy is getting enough food. Growing puppies may need up to twice the amount of food as an adult dog."
why is my puppy throwing up,Help! My Puppy Is Throwing Up,"When your puppy vomits, they forcefully expel whatever is in their stomach, and sometimes, in their upper intestines. You’ll likely see your puppy’s abdominal area heaving when they vomit.

Now, there’s a key difference between regurgitating food and true vomiting. If your puppy is regurgitating something, it’s likely to happen very soon after they eat. Whatever comes up isn’t going to be digested. In other words, you’ll see intact bits of kibble or blades of grass, and your pup may very well try to gobble them right back up.

Dogs that are regurgitating don’t feel nauseous. Dogs regurgitate food for several reasons, including if they’ve eaten too quickly or too much. If your puppy does this once or twice and returns to their normal demeanor and activity level, you’re in the clear. But if it happens frequently, then have your dog checked out by a veterinarian, because regurge can also be caused by medical conditions such as hiatal hernias or megaesophagus. In addition, you can try feeding your puppy smaller amounts more often or try a puzzle feeder designed to slow overenthusiastic eaters.

Compared to regurgitation, vomiting is different. That’s when your dog is acting sick, heaving, and ejecting food or other stomach contents that contain bile. It will look slimy and partially or fully digested. Vomiting is an active process that requires effort (heaving), regurgitation is a passive process that doesn’t require effort, dogs just burp and bring up food.

If your puppy vomits once or twice, but acts normal afterwards and doesn’t have any further issues, then you likely don’t need to seek veterinary care. However, if your vomiting puppy is showing signs of distress, including whining, acting lethargic, or uninterested in their food for more than a few hours, then call your vet. If your puppy is vomiting blood, has vomiting and diarrhea at the same time, or has eaten something toxic, don’t wait, pack up and head to the emergency vet right away.",Why Is My Puppy Vomiting?,"The most common causes of puppy vomiting include eating something that doesn’t agree with them, intestinal parasites, and parvovirus. According to WebMD, there’s a long list of potential reasons for your puppy’s vomiting. This list includes:

• Diet changes• Eating something toxic, like algae or antifreeze• Liver disease, kidney disease• Foreign substances like toys, sticks, stones, plastic, etc.• Viral or bacterial infections, including parvovirus, clostridium toxicity, etc.• Parasites in the gut• Severe Constipation• Heatstroke• Motion Sickness• Meningitis• Brain Trauma• Electrolyte imbalances• Drugs (NSAIDS, antibiotics, etc.)• Food sensitivities or intolerances• Pancreatitis• Bloat• Stress• Excessive stomach acid

It’s an alarming list – and it’s not exhaustive! Keep in mind, however, that your vet is the expert in determining the true cause of your puppy’s intestinal problems. As the pet parent, your job is to carefully note symptoms, provide an accurate picture of your dog’s diet, activity, and health, and follow up often if the problem continues.

Your veterinarian will ask questions about your puppy’s behavior before and after vomiting and want to know details about the type, quantity, and consistency of the vomit. Though it’s not exactly a fun chore, you can help by bagging up a small sample of the vomit for testing.","Why Is My Puppy’s Vomit Yellow, White, or Brown?","Puppy vomit comes in a variety of colors, depending on its cause. One of the most common colors you’ll encounter is yellow, which is the color of bile. When your puppy’s vomit is yellow, that means the food or material they’re throwing up has been in their digestive tract long enough to secrete bile.

There are multiple reasons that your puppy might throw up bile, ranging from the ordinary to the serious. As always, call your vet with any concerns. If their vomit is white or foamy, that can be the result of intense coughing or irritation.

Dark brown or black vomit can mean that your puppy simply ate dirt, and needs to throw it up. However, these colors can also represent blood in the vomit, which looks like coffee grounds. If you notice a substance that looks like coffee grounds when your puppy throws up, consult your vet immediately.

If you ever notice fresh, reddish blood in your puppy’s vomit, it might be due to a cut or an irritation in your puppy’s mouth or throat. Do a visual inspection to see if you can find a culprit – and follow up with your vet.",Vomiting vs. Regurgitating,"Before we get to the causes of vomiting, we need to distinguish between vomiting and regurgitation. When dogs vomit, they are forcefully ejecting the contents of their stomach and upper small intestine, bringing food, fluid, and debris onto your carpet. Prior to this unpleasant display, they usually exhibit signs of nausea, such as excessive drooling, retching, and contractions of the abdomen—rather like we do.

Regurgitation is different. Instead of ejecting the stomach contents by force, regurgitation is a passive motion that expels undigested food and fluids. Unlike vomiting, the signs of regurgitation are difficulty breathing and coughing. One way to tell if your dog has regurgitated instead of vomited is to look at what the dog has thrown up. Regurgitated substances are undigested and may keep the cylindrical shape of the esophagus.",When Is Dog Vomiting Normal?,"Long-term dog owners know that vomiting is not uncommon. Occasionally, healthy dogs will get sick for no apparent reason and then continue with their day as if nothing happened. Your dog could have eaten too quickly, swallowed something disagreeable, or merely snacked on too much grass. This type of vomiting is usually nothing to worry about. So how do you tell when vomiting is a cause for concern?

Your dog is most likely fine if he vomits once without any other symptoms, according to veterinarians. If your dog's vomiting can be described as any of the following, then it is time to start getting concerned:

• Continuous vomiting

• Chronic vomiting

• Vomiting a lot at one time

• Vomiting with other symptoms, like fever, weight loss, lethargy, anemia, etc.

• Vomiting blood

• Vomiting with nothing coming up

• Bloody diarrhea

• Suspected foreign body ingestion

• Seizures

It never hurts to play it safe when it comes to dog health. The best way to find out if your dog’s vomiting is normal or not is to call your vet."
how much are french bulldog puppies,History Of The French Bulldog,"The French Bulldog originally came from England, where the “toy bulldogs” were a favored pet of lacemakers. During the industrial revolution, many of the lacemakers moved to the French countryside, and it was there that through generations of breeding, the French Bulldog came to be. There’s a disagreement about how this dog originated, but the popular idea is this breed came from the toy version of the Bulldog crossed with a Pug and Terrier. Eventually, Parisians came to know and love the French Bulldog, and they became a staple of city life in Paris.

This breed was officially recognized in 1898 by the American Kennel Club (AKC).

Did You Know?

This breed cannot reproduce naturally. Due to its narrow hips, weak hind legs, and heavy build on top, male Frenchies can’t mount females. So they must be artificially inseminated to procreate. Also, because of the breed’s large head and small hips, often the mother needs a c-section, which makes breeding expensive.",How Is Their Temperament?,"Frenchies are known for their affectionate and playful ways. This breed is incredibly loyal and excellent at cuddling on your lap. They aren’t known for being aggressive, but they can exhibit undesirable behaviors such as growling or nipping without proper socialization.

Overall French Bulldogs are great companions for individuals and families since they are great with kids. This breed also does great around other pets, but don’t leave your Frenchie alone for too long because he’ll miss you terribly. Although this is a small-sized dog, this breed is not yappy, so you shouldn’t get calls from your neighbors complaining of your dog barking.

This breed doesn’t make the cut in the smartest dog breeds contest, but that doesn’t mean they lack intelligence. They seem to understand commands but choose to obey or disobey based on their mood. To some, that shows extreme intelligence.",Do French Bulldogs Have Health Issues?,"As a breed, Frenchies can suffer from various health concerns that may be problematic. These conditions include:

• Ear infections• Eye infections• Pyoderma• Dermatitis• Breathing issues• Heatstroke• Abnormal vertebrae• Hip dysplasia

Due to their short faces, their breathing is less efficient than a long-nosed dog. Also, anesthesia is less friendly for short-faced dogs, so if your dog has a severe medical issue, make sure your vet is familiar with Frenchies and how to anesthetize them. As with all pets, it’s essential to take your Frenchie to the vet regularly for checkups and vaccines.

Due to the potential costs associated with your French Bulldog’s health care needs, you may want to consider pet insurance right away to help handle the financial responsibility.

What Is A French Bulldog’s Life Expectancy?

French Bulldogs have an average lifespan of 11-13 years if they remain in good health.

Why Do French Bulldogs Fart So Much?

French Bulldogs are known to have a sensitive stomach and eat very quickly. These two things can cause them to be quite gassy. Be vigilant about keeping their diet steady as new foods can upset the balance, and watch out for signs of a food allergy. Slow down their eating by looking for a slow-feeder dog bowl that can help them pace themself. And learn more about dog farting remedies.",How Much Is A French Bulldog?,"The typical French Bulldog price is $1,800 to $4,500, with the average being $2,800. A Frenchie’s price depends on their age, genes (i.e. coat color), breeder, bloodline, pedigree and location.

Their expensive price is because of a surge in their popularity over the past two decades.

In the 90’s they ranked just 82nd place in the Kennel Club’s list of the most popular dog breeds. In the late 90’s Frenchies began increasing in popularity and achieved fourth place in 2017. In 2020 the number of Frenchie registrations increased again by 20%, propelling them to take second place from the German Shepherd. Ahead of the French Bulldog only remains the Labrador.

The most that you could possibly pay for a French Bulldog puppy would likely be around $10,000. This puppy would come from a famous breed line and have a unique coat. The average person would not pay this much for their puppy.

Adults are cheaper than puppies with a price range from $1,000 to $2,000.

The price can also vary between states based on local demand and popularity.

Price between states also fluctuates depending on the breeding rules and regulations. In some states (e.g. California) they have very strict regulations on how puppies should be raised. Breeders who violate the Commercial Pet Breeders Law would be subject to a penalty of $1,000.

These puppies will be more in urban areas as they are known to be great city dogs. For example, in California the average price is $2,900 while in Alabama it is $1,400. A French Bulldog might be less if bought from another state, but keep in mind that the difference might not be much after paying to transport them home.

Below is a list of some states from the most expensive to the cheapest.

If you are in search of a cheap French Bulldog puppy, stop. Instead, look for a senior dog from a shelter. Frenchies from shelters can be between $300 to $500. While their history and bloodline aren’t known, they can be just as healthy and full of life.",Fun Price Facts,"What Is The Most Expensive French Bulldog? The most expensive French Bulldog is valued at $100,000.

His name is Micro Machine, and is owned by Brad’s Bullies. According to Brad, Micro has an excellent body structure that is small and compact, a blue coat that is one of the best in the world and orange eyes that are rare to find on a dog.

Micro has sired over $100,000 worth of puppies, and each one can be between $5,000 to $10,000.

Most Expensive Color The Isabella French Bulldog has a pale greyish-brown or golden color. It is usually the most expensive and can be up to $50,000. Though, blue and merle Frenchies are a close second and third with prices of $10,000 and $8,000.

Some breeders consider the Isabella as the only ‘true’ lilac colored Frenchie because it carries the chocolate gene. Isabella is a result of the dilution of the recessive blue chocolate and blue genes.

Most Popular State The French Bulldog is most popular in California. These dogs are no doubt luxurious pets, and are often the companions of celebrities like Hillary Duff, Leonardo DiCaprio, Chrissy Teigen and John Legend.

Breeders like Brad’s Bullies are located in California too, so expect Frenchies to be very expensive there.

Price In The UK Contrary to common belief, the French Bulldog did not originate in France, but rather in England.

These dogs were bred from smaller English Bulldogs with the purpose of being lap dogs for lace makers. When their owners moved to France, these pups moved with them and were bred with terriers to get the French Bulldog.

In the UK, the average French Bulldog price is £3,000 ($4,500 US dollars)."
how much food should a puppy eat,What Kind Of Food?,"Generally speaking, puppy food is higher in protein and enriched with vitamins, minerals, and fats essential for growth–that is, when compared to dog food made by the same manufacturer. Still, ingredients across brands can vary greatly. Commercial puppy food must meet AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) nutrient standards for growth, and many companies go above and beyond those standards, testing their products to make sure they support puppies’ development.

They don’t have to, though–they’re only required to meet the minimum nutrient standards. In most cases, you get what you pay for. Lower-quality ingredients are found in the cheaper brands while “premium” and “performance” varieties include higher quality ingredients for improved digestibility.

Buy “puppy food.” It’s more likely to have the extra nutrients a puppy needs until he’s full grown. (Ask your vet for guidelines on when that might be–small dogs of course mature more quickly than big dogs.) Regular food labeled “for all life stages” is fine too.

Consider breed-formulated food. Large-breed puppy formulas help bigger pups grow at a rate gradual enough that they have time to develop strong bones and joints. Small-breed formulas provide concentrated nutrition in small, bite-size kibbles that meet a smaller puppy’s high metabolic needs. And, yes, medium-breed formulas aim somewhere in between. If you can’t find breed-formulated food, that’s okay.",When?,"At around eight to 12 weeks of age your puppy is probably eating three to four times a day. He doesn’t have to eat that many times though. If it suits your schedule to feed him only twice a day, just divide the amount of food you’d normally give into two meals instead of three or four.

After he’s six months old you can–and should–reduce the number of meals you feed him to two. Start reducing the amount of food he gets as well, following guidelines provided by food manufacturers, adjusting as needed. If you’re feeding too much, most dogs will let you know by leaving some behind in his bowl.

Puppy considerations

• Large-breed puppies need slow, sustained growth to help prevent orthopedic problems, such as hip dysplasia. Raise them on a diet designed for large-breed dogs or food for adult dogs. Whatever diet you choose shouldn’t overemphasize protein, fat, and calorie levels.• Small but chunky breeds, such as pugs, also need a lower-calorie diet than what’s provided by most puppy foods, because they’re also prone to hip dysplasia.• Feed your dog at set times each day rather than leaving food out all the time so he learns a schedule. The exceptions are tiny breeds such as Chihuahuas, who can be prone to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). They should always have food available to nibble on.• Never feed your puppy from the table. It only encourages begging. Everyone in the family must follow this rule.

The basis of your puppy’s diet should be a high quality balanced premium commercial puppy food that is appropriate for their life stage and health status. By reading the label, you can check that it complies with the Australian Standard for the Manufacturing and Marketing of Pet Food AS 5812:2017 [1].

Puppies should be offered food at least 4 times per day to begin with, gradually reducing the number of meals as they grow (adult dogs should be fed at least twice per day to help avoid bloat, which can be fatal).

It is important not to underfeed or overfeed puppies. Research indicates that overfeeding puppies (particularly large and giant breeds) can predispose them to muscle and bone problems. Your vet will be able to advise you on how much and what to feed your puppy.

Take your puppy to their vet regularly; they can weigh your pup, assess your pup’s body condition score and provide advice.

Fresh drinking water must be available at all times but do not offer your puppy milk as this can cause gastrointestinal upsets.",Teething,"Between four to six months of age, the permanent teeth appear and grow rapidly. Introducing puppy-specific chew toys and healthy chewable treats can alleviate “teething” issues and train your pet’s attention away from gnawing on household items. – the global Veterinary Oral Health Council lists dental products that meet standards for safety and reducing plaque/tartar.

Bones and raw meat are not recommended as they can break teeth and cause internal blockages, raw bones also carry bacteria that can make both animals and humans ill. Read the article Should I feed my dog bones? for more information.

If you do choose to offer bones to your puppy, they should always be raw and introduced gradually. The bone must be large enough so that the puppy cannot fit the whole bone in their mouth or swallow the bone whole. Avoid large hard marrow bones, T-bones, ‘chop’ bones (e.g., lamb cutlets), large knuckle bones or bones sawn lengthwise. Ask your butcher for non-bone chewy alternatives such as cow hearts. Always supervise your puppy when they are eating bones.

You should always supervise your puppy when they are eating raw bones."
how many parvo shots does a puppy need,Are Multiple Parvo Shots Really Necessary?,"Whether you’ve had a dog before or not, you probably already know that welcoming a new puppy into your life almost always requires a couple of vet trips. While the usual routine checkup is a must, your vet will also talk to you about the Parvo vaccine. They will more than likely put your puppy on a vaccination schedule once they turn eight weeks old. That means that throughout the year, you will need to bring your puppy in for a Parvo shot every three to four weeks until they reach the age of 16 weeks. A final dose is required one year after that, making it a total of three vaccinations.

To most pet parents, three Parvo shots may seem a bit concerning—excessive, even—which is completely understandable. Isn’t one vaccination enough? Does every Parvo shot increase a puppy’s immunity to the disease? Why is there a need to get puppies revaccinated every three to four weeks? Well, as unnecessary as multiple Parvo shots may seem, there is actually a good reason behind it. On top of having underdeveloped immune systems, puppies are born with maternal antibodies, which can interfere with the vaccination.","So, How Do Multiple Parvo Shots Protect Puppies?","Unfortunately, there’s no way of knowing whether or not a puppy still has their maternal antibodies. Veterinarians have simply observed that most puppies respond well to vaccinations once they reach six to eight weeks of age. However, when it comes to vaccines, guessing isn’t an option. There have been cases where puppies still have their maternal antibodies up until they are eight weeks old.

Failed vaccinations in puppies are most common when there is a presence of maternal antibodies. This is because that passive immunity can inactivate vaccines before they get the chance to trigger a response from the puppy’s immune system, preventing them from gaining immunity. In the case of Parvo, puppies receive multiple Parvo shots between the age of eight to sixteen weeks to make sure that they’re always protected. According to PetMD, puppies are likely to have no maternal antibodies left once they turn 14 to 16 weeks old, which is why the last Parvo shot is given around this time.

Ultimately, puppies can lose their maternal antibodies at any given moment. Some may become susceptible to diseases and infections at eight weeks old, others at ten weeks, and so on. To be sure that puppies are protected, they need to receive Parvo shots every three weeks starting at six to eight weeks of age up until they reach sixteen weeks of age.

Has your puppy completed their Parvo shot series?",Core and non-core vaccines,"Core vaccines are those that all dogs should receive as these protect against potentially fatal diseases. The core vaccines for dogs are canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus and canine parvovirus [1]. They are combined within a single vaccine commonly known in Australia as the C3 vaccine.

Non-core vaccines are those that are administered depending on the risk. This is based on an assessment of the dog’s location, lifestyle, and risk of exposure to the infection [1]. Therefore, it is important to ask your veterinarian about which vaccines are most appropriate for your dog. Non-core vaccines in Australia include those which provide protection against infections caused by canine parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica (these both contribute to kennel cough) and leptospirosis [1]. The canine parainfluenza virus and Bordetella bronchiseptica vaccine (more commonly known together with the core vaccines as a C5 vaccine) is recommended for dogs who regularly come into contact with other dogs, such as on walks, at the park, day-care, puppy preschool, or boarding [2].

The leptospirosis vaccination is recommended for dogs who are in at-risk areas, have access to stagnant bodies of water, or have contact with livestock or rodents [1, 2]. Leptospirosis is also a zoonotic disease, which means animals, including dogs, can pass the disease on to humans [2].

Australia is a rabies-free country and thus a rabies vaccine is not necessary for dogs remaining in Australia. If you are planning on taking your dog overseas, you will need to speak to your veterinarian about what vaccinations will be necessary for your dog to travel to and live in the destination country.",Adult dog vaccinations,"Once your dog has completed all their core puppy vaccinations and the booster, your dog requires their core vaccination every 1-3 years [1], depending on the duration of immunity provided by the vaccine your veterinarian uses – it is best to check with your veterinarian which vaccination they use. If your veterinarian has recommended any of the non-core vaccinations (canine parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica or leptospirosis), they are required annually [1].

If you attain a dog of any age with an unknown vaccination history, you may need to ensure that the dog has a full initial course of vaccines like a puppy does to ensure adequate protection. It is best to speak to your veterinarian about this and also if you intend to relocate interstate or to a new country.

Your veterinarian will always do a health check before administering a vaccination to ensure your puppy or dog is healthy. The core vaccines used in dogs are very safe with a very low incidence of adverse reactions. The benefits of protection from serious infectious disease significantly outweigh the risks of developing an adverse reaction [1]. If you have any concerns about adverse vaccine reactions or the health of your dog, it is best to speak to your veterinarian.",What Do Vaccinations Do?,"Vaccinations protect your dog against an array of illnesses. The basic premise of a vaccine is to prepare the immune system to recognize an infectious organism and effectively fend off that organism when it invades the body. That preparation involves developing antibodies that will specifically recognize and target infectious foreign invaders.

Vaccines are made in different ways. We won’t bog you down with all the technical details, but we can give you a basic overview. Some vaccines are called ‘modified live vaccines,’ containing small bits of live but weakened virus to activate the immune system. Others are killed vaccines, which contain dead virus. There are also vector vaccines, which use genetics to provide strong and durable protection against disease.

Some vaccines require what’s known as a booster, which is given at a specified time after the initial vaccination to help keep the vaccine effective over time."
how much should a puppy eat,How much to feed puppies,"Puppies’ nutritional needs are of course different from an adult or even adolescent dog. For starters, they often eat more times a day than adult dogs. Depending on your pup’s breed and age, she may eat up to four meals per day or two to three times the amount of an adult dog.

AKC recommends a method called “watch the dog, not the dish.” Giving puppies a schedule for their meals, and then taking away any leftover food 10-20 minutes after a meal is served, helps to establish good eating habits.

This method will help you to learn how much your puppy needs and helps your pup to establish good habits, as in: if you’re hungry, eat!

If a puppy misses out by not eating enough at one meal, their hunger will help them finish their meal at the next feeding and learn to eat when the food is available. And because they have frequent meals, they won’t go hungry for long.",How to tell if your dog’s weight is healthy,"According to PetMD, there are a few telltale signs that your dog is at a good weight. You can survey your dog’s shape quickly to determine if she’s where she needs to be.

First, your dog should have an “hourglass” figure when you look at her from above. What this means is that you should see wider shoulders and ribs, a tapering behind her ribcage, then widening again at her hips.

Second, when looking at her from the size, she should be “tucked up,” which means that her ribs should be closer to the ground than her belly.

Last, her ribs shouldn’t be visible, but you should be able to feel them with your hand with only slight pressure. This quick survey should help you to gauge whether your dog is getting enough food and exercise, or if she needs to have her food intake adjusted.",How to tell if nursing puppies aren’t getting enough to eat,"Veterinary experts say that newborn puppies should gain 5% to 10% of their body weight daily and should double their body weight in one week. Jerry Klein, the chief veterinary officer at the American Kennel Club (AKC), recommends using a baby scale to monitor the weight gain of each puppy. Puppies should be weighed at birth, and again at 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 3 days, 5 days, and 7 days. If everything is going well, all puppies should show a gradual weight gain.

If newborns are crying during or after nursing this might signal that they aren’t getting enough milk or that mom’s milk is infected, according to experts at the VCA animal hospital group. It could also mean that they are sick and if crying is excessive, mom and babies should be checked by a veterinarian.",What to feed newborn puppies without their mom,"Veterinarians say that the best replacement milk for puppies is commercial puppy milk formula. Best Friends Animal Society recommends the Esbliac puppy milk replacer when feeding orphan puppies. Veterinary experts say that any puppy milk replacer should contain optimal levels of omega-3 fatty acid and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), a nutrient that is important for the development of the puppies’ brains and eyes. Containers will come with feeding instructions and these should be followed carefully. Just as with newborn babies, the milk can be tested on your forearm before feeding. It should be about the same temperature as your skin or only slightly warmer.

As you feed your newborn be aware that overfeeding may put a puppy at risk of aspiration, vomiting, diarrhea, and gas build-up in the stomach and intestines. Maddie’s Fund provides a helpful newborn puppy feeding chart broken down by calorie requirements and formula measurements based on a puppy’s weight.",How to feed a newborn puppy,"• A puppy nursing bottle is the best way to feed a newborn. The size of the hole in the nipple is crucial to successful bottle feeding, according to experts at Best Friends. To check this, turn the bottle upside down and gently squeeze, and if the milk drips freely the hole is too large. That means the puppy could take in too much milk and risk inhaling it into their lungs. If the hole is too small the puppy has to work too hard to get nourishment and may refuse to nurse. The hole is the proper size if, when the bottle is squeezed gently, the milk comes out a small drop at a time.

• Puppies shouldn’t be fed on their backs because they don’t have a well-developed gag reflex and there’s a danger that fluid may go down their windpipe and enter their lungs. Instead, place the puppy on his stomach with his head level as if he was nursing from his mom.

• Open the puppy’s mouth gently with one finger and place the tip of the nipple on his tongue. If he won’t eat, try stroking him. Tilt the bottle up slightly to prevent the puppy from inhaling too much air. Do not force the puppy to nurse, or allow him to nurse too fast.

• After each feeding, the puppy should be burped by holding him against your shoulder and gently patting his back.

According to the AKC, some orphan puppies take a little time to get the knack of the sucking part of feeding. If a pup doesn’t drink from the bottle you’ll need to work with a veterinarian to tube feed the puppy to get him started. In addition to feedings, for the first 2 weeks, orphan pups should be stimulated to urinate and defecate after each meal. This is done by rubbing the area between the back legs with a warm wet cotton ball. This action mimics the licking mom does to stimulate her puppies to eliminate."
how much are puppy shots,Why do puppies and dogs need vaccinations?,"Vaccinations are given to prevent your pet from contracting contagious diseases. Some areas will give vaccinations for specific diseases that are prevalent or that your pup is at high risk for. There are a core set of vaccinations, however, that are given to puppies beginning at six to eight weeks of age.

Puppies are particularly susceptible to diseases such as rabies, parvovirus, distemper, and hepatitis. They are immunized against these illnesses through a series of vaccinations given in their first three months of life.

Regardless of whether you are adopting a puppy or an adult dog, consult with your veterinarian to find out what vaccinations your pet needs and the schedule that’s appropriate. If you’re unsure of the animal’s previous vaccination history, your vet may advise that you give a series of booster shots to make sure they are up to date.

If you live in an area that is prone to ticks, we recommend asking your veterinarian for medication/vaccinations to prevent tick-borne diseases. They can give you the information you need for any illnesses present in your region or state.",Pros of vaccinating your dog,"The biggest argument for vaccination your dog or puppy is the prevention of life-threatening illnesses. While most pet owners today have never experienced a pet who has contracted parvovirus or distemper, these illnesses are devastating. They not only endanger your dog’s life but can cause extreme suffering.

Young puppies are the perfect targets for viruses and bacteria:  they lick, bite, and chew on everything, and they have a weak defense system against disease because they’re so young. This is why veterinarians place such high importance on puppy vaccinations.

Vaccines, however, are becoming the victims of their success. Many of the diseases dogs are vaccinated against are now virtually non-existent. It’s not likely that your dog will come into contact with a dog with distemper in the dog park because the domestic dog population has herd immunity against it. The majority of dogs are vaccinated, which gives non-vaccinated dogs protection. This is the same concept as the human Poliovirus. The virus has been virtually eradicated due to vaccination, so even unvaccinated individuals are unlikely to contract it.

The concept of herd immunity can give pet owners a false sense of security. Diseases, like canine distemper, for example, still exist in wild animals. The reason you don’t know dogs with distemper is that they’re vaccinated. It does not mean that your unvaccinated pet can’t get sick.",Risk Assessment,"Serious side effects of vaccines are very rare. While they tend to cause a vaccine backlash in the media, it’s important to put it in perspective.

It is a certainty that vaccinations protect your dog from potentially life-threatening diseases. These diseases have a very high mortality rate, and your dog is at risk if he is unvaccinated. The vaccines themselves have a very low risk of causing a serious reaction in your dog.

It’s also important to be aware that allergic reactions are treatable when caught early. For this reason, your veterinarian will often ask you to stay at the clinic for a period of time following vaccine administration so that any reaction can be reversed.

We have given you the average costs of dog and puppy vaccinations to help you include this in your budget for your pet. Which vaccinations are recommended for your pet should be discussed with your veterinarian based on your lifestyle and the region in which you live. Vaccines are an important part of your dog’s health care, as they prevent your dog or puppy from contracting life-threatening illnesses.

Featured Image Credit: New Africa, Shutterstock",How much do dog vaccinations cost?,"Vaccines are recommended by veterinarians based on a pup’s breed, age, health, lifestyle and medical history, as well as whether your dog lives or travels to states known for specific diseases. The price of inoculations will, therefore, depend on which core and non-core shots are required.

Most shelter and rescue groups include vaccinations in their adoption fee so that a newly adopted dog or puppy is ready to get off to a healthy start in their new home. Below is an estimate of dog vaccination costs to give you an idea of what to expect when discussing your puppy shot schedule with your veterinarian.

• Vaccines and routine care – 1st year: $100-$350 | Annual cost: $80-$250

• Heartworm tests – 1st year: $0-$35 | Annual cost: $0-$35

• Heartworm prevention – 1st year: $24-$120 | Annual cost: $36-$132

• Flea and tick prevention – 1st year: $40-$200 | Annual cost: $40-$200

• Distemper vaccination – 1st year: $20-$30 | Annual cost: $40-$60

• Rabies vaccination – 1st year: $15-$25

• Deworming – 1st year: $20-$50 | Annual cost: $80-$200",When do I need to vaccinate my puppy?,"The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) recommends that your puppy gets 3 rounds of the C3 between 6 and 16 weeks of age. The organisation says not to give your pup its last shot before 16 weeks. Here's what the ideal puppy vaccination schedule looks like:

It's important to stick to this schedule as closely as possible for a number of reasons:

• You need to allow at least four weeks between each vaccination.• You want to give your pup the final round of puppy vaccination no earlier than 16 weeks because that's when the dog's immune system is most capable of responding to the vaccine.• You want all three rounds of puppy vaccination completed a soon as possible so your pup can get out into the world and socialise freely."
how much is a husky puppy,Siberian Husky Puppy Price (Breeder),"A puppy from an American Kennel Club registered breeder with health certified parents will cost more than a puppy from a backyard breeder, pet store or puppy farm.

Backyard breeders might charge $500, where a reputable certified breeder is likely to sell a Siberian Husky puppy for $1,000 to $2,500. Price differences are driven by purebred status, puppy welfare and registration charges.

Different breeders will have different prices for their puppies depending on the colors and size of their dogs. This means puppies from the same litter can also be priced differently.

A pure white is very desirable, very rare and is also the most expensive. If you have your heart set on one of these puppies expect to pay anywhere from $2,000 upwards.

Huskies can also have different types of coats; for instance, some puppies have wooly coats instead of the traditional double-layered coat. Wooly coated Huskies are cheaper.

Buying a Husky puppy from a pet store is also an option, although it is not recommended. You cannot assure the quality of the dog or the care and have no option to meet the parents. You also cannot assure the puppy was bred from a reputable breeder.

Another cheap option is buying through classified ads. Buying from classified ads is not recommended for the same reasons as pet stores. They generally do not ethically breed their dogs or screen them for health problems. This results in many Siberian Husky puppies being born with lifelong health issues.

It is the most responsible option to purchase from a professional breeder.

Reputable breeders put a lot of work, time, and care into raising puppies so the price goes mostly into the puppies’ expenses rather than profit.",Husky Price (Adoption),"Unfortunately, due to their cost and training difficulty, the number of Huskies surrendered at shelters has increased drastically in the last few years. These reasons include behavioral issues, difficulty training and high energy personalities.

Adoption is much cheaper than purchasing a purebred puppy from a breeder.

Generally, senior dogs are the cheapest to adopt, and they get more expensive as they get younger.

Many rescues will charge on average around $350 for a purebred Husky puppy. This price is normally based on the cost it took to care for the puppy until its adoption. This care includes food, housing, and veterinary bills.

If you are not interested in adopting a puppy, senior dogs will cost less. Some run as low as $125. Older Siberian Husky dogs come with the benefit of being more mellow and more likely to be housebroken.

Not only is rescuing cheaper, but it also means you are giving a dog in need a new home!

Just remember to research potential rescue groups before adopting to ensure they take proper care of their dogs. Reputable rescues are more expensive, ensure the dog is healthy, and will arrange a home visit before adoption.

Finally, waiting for re-homing is another possibility.

Some people buy a Siberian Husky and due to unforeseen circumstances they can no longer take care of them. Most people charge anywhere from $100 to $400 as a re-homing fee to ensure a good home for their dog. While this initially might seem like a great deal, keep in mind you may not know the true reasons for the dog being re-homed and you could end up buying a Husky with severe behavior issues.",Most Expensive,"The most expensive coat color is Agouti. This is because it is one of the rarest colors for the breed. An agouti has a dark brown to black coat with grey to tan highlights.

This color makes a Siberian Husky look like a wolf; though they should not be confused for a Malamute.

The reason why agouti is so rare is that breeders rarely breed specifically for it. If someone is looking for an agouti, their best chance at finding one is through sled dog breeders, where the color is more common. Be prepared to save up, though, because the most expensive agouti Siberian Husky will cost over $3000.

A Siberian Husky dog with a heterochromia will also be pricier than their littermates.

Heterochromia is when each eye is a different color. A heterochromatic Husky typically has one brown and one blue eye. Some Native American cultures consider the blue Husky eye to be a “ghost eye”, allowing the dog to see the heavens. This, coupled with heterochromia, is why a Siberian Husky with mismatched eyes can sell for over $2,000.",Husky puppies in classifieds,"The fastest and cheapest way to acquire a puppy is through your local classifieds. You can find them for $200 there – perhaps even lower if somebody really needs the pups sold quickly.

But before you jump on the deal, watch out: These puppies have the highest likelihood of health issues.

While Huskies are generally healthy dogs, parents of any future litter need to be checked for some breed-specific conditions, such as cataracts. Young puppies also absolutely need veterinary care so they can be dewormed and vaccinated.

While you may be able to get your puppy for a steal on Craigslist, you need to add the future vet costs on top of the sale price. Taking your new puppy for an exam, shots, deworming and a possible spay or neuter surgery can easily run $100-$400.

If you are looking for a way to get a Husky puppy for a lower price and have him in good health, you should consider a rescue.",Cost of a Husky from a breeder,"If you decide to go with a breeder you can expect to pay the highest price – about $1,200 an average.

While this seems steep, it comes with additional upsides. Breeders invest decades into building good lines of breeding dogs. They will know the parents’ temperament and disposition and of course have made sure that they do not have any health issues. Many puppies that come from breeders have parents who are AKC champions or have titles in other venues.

Are you planning on taking your Husky to AKC dog shows or participating in events with him? The purchasing a Husky from a breeder at a higher cost is the way to go.

Breeders have detailed knowledge of the parents’ character. If you are planning on adding a Husky to a family with children and/or other dogs, you may want to pick that option. The same applies for Huskies that should become ESAs (Emotional Support Animals).

Breeders usually let puppies go to their homes after being dewormed and vaccinated, but without a spay or neuter surgery.

A special kind of Husky breeders are racing sled dog kennels. They produce dogs for sled dog races and sell puppies on the side. You should only get a puppy from such a breeder if you are ready to offer him a lot of exercise and activities – running is in their blood!"
how often should puppies eat,From eight weeks to six months,"After the first few weeks of life, your pup is ready to wean to solid food. This is a gradual process that takes two to three weeks to complete. Talk to your vet and select a high-calorie puppy food that meets their dietary needs.

Once you’re ready to start weaning, introduce the puppy food by mixing it with formula. Blend your dog’s new food with the milk replacer and offer the gruel three to four times a day. If your puppy takes it well, you can slowly reduce the amount of milk until you eliminate it altogether.

This gentle process ensures that your puppy doesn’t suffer from an upset stomach and adapts to solid food. It also starts to get your pooch on a regular feeding schedule, which is important for housetraining and their development.

Keeping in mind that every puppy has a different metabolism and energy levels, these are the basic feeding guidelines for puppies under six months old:

Toy breeds usually eat four to six meals per day.

Medium-sized puppies need three meals every day.

Large breed puppies require three to four meals per day.",After your puppy is one year old,"Around their first birthday, many puppies are considered adult dogs. Of course, they’ll always be your baby but their nutritional needs change at this point and it may be time to switch them to adult food. Consult with your dog’s vet to make sure they’ve reached maturity, because larger breeds may take up to two years to fully develop into adult dogs. In general, these are the maturity patterns of different breeds:

Small breeds up to 30 pounds mature between 10 and 12 months of age.

Medium breeds up to 80 pounds reach maturity between 12 and 16 months.

Large breeds that weigh over 80 pounds may not reach maturity until they’re two years old.

Once your vet determines that your pooch has reached maturity, switching to adult food should also be a gradual process. Start by adding small amounts of adult food to their puppy food, and gradually increase the proportion of adult food until you’ve made a full transition. This process should take one to two weeks to avoid upset tummies.",Other things to consider,"Foods to avoid: Paying close attention to the ingredients in your dog’s food helps avoid corn or meat by-products. For best results, look for brands with meat as their first ingredient.

How not to overfeed: Free feeding your dog often leads to weight problems and health complications. If your vet determines that your dog is overweight, limit your dog’s intake and adjust their diet as recommended by the doctor. Sticking to a schedule helps avoid overfeeding and keeps your dog regular.

Considering fresh food: Many dog parents prefer fresh dog food over kibble or processed wet food. Whether you make natural dog food at home or buy it from a store, remember that puppies have different nutritional needs so make sure you’re feeding your pup the right food for their age.

Learning how much to feed a puppy is a matter of experience and your dog’s individual needs. By providing your pup with an age-appropriate diet and a feeding schedule, you can keep them healthy and strong. Good eating habits are key to preventing future health complications so you and your furry friend can enjoy each other’s company and a lifetime of love.

And what time should I feed my puppy?,” perhaps it’s best to illustrate with a sample schedule. Here is one example of how to plan meal times when feeding puppies. It can be adjusted to fit your lifestyle, just make sure the meals are spaced out about five hours apart:

• First meal/breakfast: 7:00 a.m.

• Second meal/lunch: 12:00 p.m. (noon)

• Third meal/dinner: 5:00 p.m.

PetMD recommends you stick to a feeding schedule like this until the puppy reaches 14-18 weeks of age. At about four months of age, dog owners can transition to feeding their puppy two meals a day. Regardless of age, have fresh water available at all times.

Additionally, if your puppy turns out to be the type of eater who basically vacuums their meals out of the bowl with minimal chewing, try a slow feeder or food-dispensing toy to get them to slow down. Inhaling food can be dangerous because as your puppy is gulping the food up, they swallow air that expands in their stomach and causes gastric upset. It’s also a choking hazard.

The schedule above is a good standard suggestion for puppy feeding, but you should check with your veterinarian if you have any concerns about feeding your puppy.",Puppy Nutrition and Feeding Tips,"So, How often should I feed my puppy? As mentioned, you should feed your pup about three times a day. Stick to a routine. Talk to your vet about what to feed your puppy, especially if you have a large-breed dog or dog that requires a special diet.

Keep a consistent feeding schedule and adjust how your puppy is fed if they’re the type of eater that gobbles up all their food in one breath. If you have any questions, consult your veterinarian. Puppies are hard work, but you have the tools to set them up for success and keep them healthy in the long term.

how often do puppies pee,How Often Should a Puppy Pee?,"Puppies have small bladders, which is why they need to pee so often. A good rule to follow is that pups have control of their bladders for as long as they are old, at least up to about 9 months of age. That means 1-month-old puppies should go to the bathroom every hour, while 6-month-old puppies should be able to control their bladders for up to 6 hours. However, every dog is different, so your dog may not follow this strictly.

You should also know that when very young puppies drink water, their bladders fill up fast, so they’ll usually need to go pee between 10 and 30 minutes later.

So, if you have a puppy around 9 weeks of age, taking them out every one to two hours is the place to begin, as is taking them out quickly after meals. Then, as they get older, you can begin to lengthen the time between potty breaks. Between 4 and 6 months of age, puppies should have almost complete control of their bladders.",How Often Do Puppies Need to Pee at Night?,"The good news is that puppies are a little better at controlling their bladders during sleep! You can help them out, though, by removing their bowl of water a couple of hours before bed so they don’t drink too much before sleeping. It’s also advisable that you crate your dog overnight, as dogs are less likely to pee in their own space due to their dislike of uncleanliness. Just make sure you don’t get an overly large crate, as they could simply pee in the corner, then sleep away from it. You might also want to put a puppy pad down in case of accidents.

That said, with younger pups, in particular, you’re likely going to need to take at least one mid-night bathroom break (following the rule from above, if your puppy is 4 months of age or under and you sleep for 8 hours, you’ll need one break). If your pup is sleeping in their crate in your room, you’ll likely be woken up by them whining or scratching as they signal they need to go out. However, if you’re a heavy sleeper who isn’t likely to hear them, you’d be better off setting an alarm to wake yourself up for your pet’s potty break.

When you do get up to take your dog out to pee, you’ll need to be careful not to rile them up into thinking it’s playtime. Don’t give your pup a lot of attention; simply take them out, then put them right back in the crate. If you give your puppy lots of praise and pets during these mid-night runs, you may find them waking you up just for attention rather than for a need to urinate.",How Often Should a Puppy Pee? What’s Normal?,"Adult dogs can hold their bladder for impressive lengths of time. Many only require three trips outside per day, meaning that they are waiting at least 8 hours between pit stops.

But young puppies, whose bladders are much smaller and bladder control much poorer, must be allowed to tinkle far more often than this.

Even if it seems like your dog is peeing in the house right after being outside, it could have already felt like an eternity for your little fella!

For example, an adult dog may drain his water dish and then go fall asleep on the couch all night before needing to pee in the morning. He may really need to go by the time he licks you into a conscious state around 6 AM, but he’ll hold it all night without problem.

Conversely, puppies will usually need to void their bladder within 10 to 30 minutes of filling up their tanks.

In general, young puppies (less than about 6 months old) should be taken out once every hour or two. The AKC suggests that puppies can wait for the same number of hours as their age in months up to about 9 months of age.

This means that a 1-month-old puppy will need to pee every hour, while a 5-month-old puppy will need to relieve himself every 5 hours.

So, if your 5-month-old puppy needs a break every hour or two, something is probably wrong, and you should consult your veterinarian to get your puppy the help he needs.

Your vet can help you treat medical problems, but if your pup is healthy, the root of the problem is probably behavioral in nature. You’ll have to correct these problems (potentially with the help of a trainer or behaviorist).",Breeds That May Be Difficult to Housebreak,"Many breeders, veterinarians and trainers consider some breeds to require more frequent bathroom trips or to be more difficult to housebreak than others. However, others dispute this notion, and believe that things like breed and size fail to have an effect on a dog’s need to urinate.

But whether a dog’s breed influences his need to go outside, or if this perceived phenomenon is nothing more than confirmation bias or an example of correlation, rather than causation; the following breeds are among those who experience these problems the most.

Fortunately, most of them are small, which limits the size of the ensuing mess.

• Pekingese• Jack Russell terrier• Bichon Frise• Yorkshire terrier• Maltese• Pug• Beagle• Bassett Hound• Chihuahua• Whippet• Dachshund• Pomeranian

Of course, these aren’t the only breeds that can suffer from peeing problems, but they are among those who suffer from these types of problems the most. Just know that if you share your life with one of these four-footers, you may need to provide more frequent potty breaks and be ready to deal with the occasional puddle.

Are you battling a puppy who is constantly making puddles around the house? What types of strategies have you used to correct the problem? Has your vet diagnosed your pup with a bladder infection or other health issue, or is the problem rooted in your dog’s behavior?

Tell us all about your experiences in the comments, below. You never know when your experiences will help someone else out.","

Diabetes","Diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas either fails to produce enough insulin (the hormone used to process glucose, or blood sugar), or the body becomes insensitive to the insulin produced.

In either case, the result is high blood sugar, which triggers a dog’s kidneys to shed water, thereby stimulating the puppy to empty his bladder. This is one of the common medical reasons a dog may pee while they sleep. Another common symptom of diabetes is excessive drinking and thirst, which exacerbates the peeing problem.

Diabetes is often a congenital defect, which can strike puppies at a relatively early age. While imminently treatable, diabetes cannot be cured. Naturally, it’s important to consult a veterinarian anytime you suspect your dog may be diabetic. You may also need to switch your pooch to a diabetic dog food."
how much to feed a puppy by age,How many meals per day should I feed my puppy? ,"Ideally puppies should be fed little and often by providing small portions from their daily food ration at regular intervals throughout the day. When you first bring your pup home, start by feeding the number of meals your breeder has suggested. After this, general guidelines from the PFMA advise feeding four meals per day up until they are four months old, then three meals a day until they are six months old, then two meals a day after this, although this might vary based on your individual puppy’s requirements.  Always monitor their growth and overall body condition to get an idea of how their food intake is supporting their growth and activity.  Remember that very young puppies grow fast and that growth rates slow down as they reach maturity and adulthood.",What is the difference between your puppy diets? ,"• The Field & Trial Puppy Chicken is a poultry-based diet which is high in protein and fat to support the early growth and development stages of a young dog. It is an ideal choice for the majority of breeds.

• The Field & Trial Puppy & Junior Duck & Rice contains a marine algae source of DHA omega 3 fatty acids to support cognitive development and is made using a sensitive recipe, making it ideal for puppies with dietary sensitivities. It also provides a good source of protein and fat to support their early growth and development.

• The Field & Trial Puppy Lamb & Rice is an ideal choice for large to giant breeds as it has managed protein, fat and mineral levels to encourage gradual, healthy growth and has a larger bite size than our other two puppy diets. Equally this food can be suited to other breeds of dog and because of its managed nutrient levels, can also be fed as a junior diet.

It’s also important to note that all of our diets are nutritionally complete and so do not require additional supplementation.",Developing a Routine,"Your puppy should be weaned from their mother and started on solid foods before being placed with you. Ask the breeder or rescue how often they feed your puppy.  If possible, find out what food this is before you bring your new puppy home and get some of the same. You might or might not want to keep your pup on that food, but it is best to change foods gradually, and important to do your research before deciding which puppy food to go for.

Puppies usually need the opportunity to toilet shortly after they eat. They don’t have much bladder or bowel control yet, but it is up to their owners to bring them to the right place at the right time. When they succeed, praising them will help develop a habit of going in that spot. If they do their business elsewhere, don’t make a fuss about it. Simply clean it up quickly with any reaction at all.

Playtime should be before they eat because being too active after eating can upset their stomach. Also, they are likely to be inclined for a nap when their belly is full. A good routine is play time, food, toileting, quiet time.",How Much to Feed Your New Puppy?,"This is one of the biggest questions, and the answer depends on the pup’s size and activity level and the specific food. The bag should have guidelines for feeding your pup based on weight and/ or age. Of course, your pup is growing constantly, so you will be increasing the amount of food. Weigh your puppy weekly to make sure you are giving an appropriate amount for their current weight.

When you buy your first bag of puppy food, ask the pet store for a measuring scoop and be sure it is one provided by the company that makes that food. These scoops are not interchangeable because the different sizes and shapes of dry dog food mean they fit into a measure differently.

The feeding guides on dog food usually give a range, not one specific amount. All pups are different. Start with an amount in the middle of the range and see how your pup eats. You can adjust based on that, and it is fine to keep adjusting. You pup might be hungrier at one meal than another or eat more for a week. That’s normal.",How to Change Your Puppy’s Food,"When you need to change your dog’s food, do so gradually. Whether you are switching brands or going from puppy to adult food, changing abruptly can upset your dog’s tummy. For puppies, take the time to switch foods slowly in four steps. Mix the foods according to this schedule for every feed. Don’t alternate and feed different foods for different meals.

how to crate train a puppy at night,How To Stop A Puppy From Barking In His Crate At Night,"Now that we have the basics of crate training down. Let’s talk about the reason why we’re all here…a barking puppy and tips to remedy said barker…

Over the past 10 years we’ve learned quite a bit about crate training starting with:

• Crate training our first puppy, Linus who we rescued from the animal shelter• Crate training litters of puppies as foster parents• And finally, crate training over a dozen service dog puppies

As you might have guessed over those 10 years we’ve learned many crate training tips and tricks.

In Episode 1 of Puppy In Training TV we talked about some of the first things we do when bringing home a puppy.

We also talked a little bit about how to crate train a puppy and Dublin’s first night in his crate.

Lucky for us there weren’t too many nights of Dublin howling in his crate although we did catch a little bit of whining on video – see below.

Take a look at some of the basics in our first episode of Puppy In Training TV:",Should I Ignore Puppy Barking In Crate At Night?,"ANSWER: Yes and No, it depends on your puppy. One thing we’ve learned over the years is that puppies will bark for different reasons while their in the crate. In general if our puppy is barking we’ll ignore him for at least the first 10-15 minutes. Most will calm down after that time. As soon as our puppy is calm we give him praise.

However, as I said it depends on your puppy. You do not want to ignore your puppy if:

• He’s experiencing anxiety in the crate. In this case we try to take a slower approach to introducing our puppy to the crate.• He has to go potty.• He’s experiencing some kind of health issue.

If you’re having problems with your puppy barking in his crate then leave us a comment or even better contact a local certified professional dog trainer.",What Should I Put In My Puppy’s Crate At Night?,"ANSWER: We start all of our puppies off with two items in the crate. A Snuggle Puppy Heartbeat Toy and a blanket. We then monitor our puppy to make sure he does not destroy the Snuggle Puppy and/or blanket.

However, the long answer for what should I put in my puppy’s crate is it depends. If we have a destructive puppy then we may not want to have anything in the crate.

If our puppy is having potty accidents in the crate then we take out the blanket.

If our puppy is having trouble getting used to the crate then we’ll sometimes use different types of toys like Nylabones, KONGs, and even chews like Bully Sticks.

If you put a toy or chew that your puppy could potentially destroy or swallow like plush toys and bully sticks then be sure and supervise him while he’s in the crate with said toys until you’re certain he’s not going to swallow or choke on anything.",What Is Puppy Crate Training?,"Before learning how to crate train a puppy, we should first be clear on what crate training truly is.

It’s the process we go through to teach our puppy that their crate is a special happy place all of their own, a place where only good things happen, so they become willing and even look forward to spending calm, relaxed time there.

A crate-trained dog will voluntarily go in and out of its crate without any force, feel comfortable being locked in occasionally, and will be calm inside, causing no fuss and showing no signs of stress.

They will look and feel safe and secure, look perfectly happy with no crying for release, and often head to the crate of their own accord.

QUICK RECOMMENDATION: We recommend the Midwest Life Stages Crate. We bought it for our first puppy, Linus over 14 years ago and still use the same crate today.",Why Do We Go Through The Effort Of Crate Training A Puppy?,"Because without first going through a crate training process, if you tried to crate your puppy they will almost certainly be afraid, feel isolated, and fear the crate instead of loving it.

By taking the time to go through small incremental steps, from slowly introducing your puppy to the crate, to spending small but increasing amounts of time in there, they will learn to love it and you can both enjoy the enormous benefits it offers.

Many people say their dog loves being in their crate when in fact this isn’t nearly always true.

Until you can ask your dog to go to the crate, they do so happily and when they get there they look truly happy to get inside and relax, play with a toy, and never cry to get out even with the door closed, then crate training is something you need to spend time on.

And until you have fully crate trained your puppy, you will not be able to take advantage of the many benefits it offers to both you and your puppy. Such as:

• Providing a place of their own for comfort and security• Speeding up the house training process• Keeping your puppy safe when you cannot supervise them• Protecting your possessions when you cannot supervise your puppy• Preparing your puppy for time crated at the vets or boarding kennels• …And much more besides!

QUICK RECOMMENDATION: Another tool we love for house training is the dog potty doorbell called the Smart Bell. It takes a little bit of training, the Smart Bell alerts you when your puppy has to potty and it’s also great when working on the cue “Touch”."
how to get my puppy to stop biting,#2. They are OVEREXCITED,"Young puppies have not yet learned to regulate their emotional arousal. When then become overly excited or aroused, they start to lose inhibition and self-control, which leads to them getting extra bitey.

How You Can Help Your Puppy:

• Imagine your pup’s excitability on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is totally calm and relaxed, and 10 is a full-on case of the puppy zoomies.

• When you see your pup’s excitement level creeping up to a 7 or 8 during play, help them learn to stop, take a breath, and calm down a bit.

• You can do this by modeling calm, relaxed behavior yourself: slow down your movements, blink your eyes softly, and stay quiet or speak only using low, slow tones.

• With practice, your pup will quickly learn to take their cues from you that it’s times to take a break and settle down.

• You can also practice playing “Go Wild & Freeze” with your pup, like Trainer Lauren is doing in this video with Camper Donnie:",#3. They are FRUSTRATED,"Just as very young children may feel the desire to hit, slap, or kick when frustrated, young puppies will often use their teeth to display frustration and anger. It is easy to view frustrated biting as a puppy being obnoxious or “bratty.” But try to remember that frustration is a really icky emotion, and it is often born from feelings of confusion and/or lack of control about a situation.

How You Can Help Your Puppy:

• If you see your puppy becoming frustrated, first try to identify the source of frustration (for example, being restrained, being brushed, having a toy taken away, etc.).

• Then, recreate easier versions of that scenario, and reward your puppy for doing whatever it is you’d like them to do INSTEAD of biting and nipping. In the video below, Camper Gizmo learns to accept brushing without getting frustrated and mouthy.

• In addition, impulse control games are a great way to help your puppy learn more productive, socially appropriate ways to cope with feelings of frustration.",#4. Your actions say “BITE ME”,"There are some things we humans do that are the equivalent of wearing a great big “Bite Me” sign on our backs! Here are a couple of common ones:

• Sitting on the floor for prolonged periods of time with an excited, active puppy. Why? When you sit on the floor, you are likely to become a living, breathing climbing apparatus, complete with all kinds of fun knobs and doohickies on which to gnaw and pull: your nose, ears, hair, the strings on your sweatshirt, and more.

• Making high-pitched squealing noises and quick, jerky movements. There is a reason puppy toys have squeakers 🙂 . When we make high-pitched noises and quickly pull our hands away from a puppy, they instinctively respond with chasing and nipping.

How You Can Help Your Puppy:

• Instead of sitting cross-legged on the floor, try sitting on your knees. This makes it easy for you to quickly straighten up and remove access to your lap if your pup becomes nippy.

• Avoid making too many squeal-y, overly excited sounds around your puppy (though a higher pitched “pup-pup-pup” or kissy noise is a great way to entice your puppy to come to you). And, keep your movements controlled. If your puppy nips at you, try freezing instead of jerking your hand away.",Regular play with other dogs,"Pups usually learn the strength of their bite during the first few weeks of life with their siblings. Insufficient opportunities to practice this can result in a lack of bite inhibition in older dogs – meaning more scratches for you! If you find your puppy is a bit too nippy for your liking, they might need to spend more time with their own kind.

It’s your job to provide plenty of opportunities for your puppy to interact with other puppies and friendly, vaccinated adult dogs. They’ll expend a lot of their energy playing with other puppies and learn boundaries from the dogs around them. Consider enrolling your puppy in a good puppy class, where they can have supervised playtime with other puppies and learn some important new skills. For more advice on choosing puppy classes or behaviourists, view our webpage on choosing the right dog trainer.",Re-direct the bite,"Mouthing is a normal dog behaviour, so disciplining them isn’t the route to take. Instead, positively redirect them by giving your pup something satisfying to chew on that isn’t your hand. Supplying your puppy with plenty of toys and tricky-to-tackle treats will keep them entertained for hours and keep your hand slobber free. When your puppy goes to bite you, quickly replace your hand with a chewy treat such as raw hide, pig’s ears or even a raw bone for a quick fix.

Encourage forms of play that don’t require contact, such as fetch and tug of war. Once your puppy gets the hang of it, quickly redirect him to these forms of play whenever he starts to mouth or nip you. Ideally, he will begin to search for the toy whenever he feels like mouthing."
how to train a puppy to walk on a leash,Pick a side!,"Depending on what’s going on around you, it might be easier or safer to have your dog on one side or another, but, in general, you don’t want your dog to be crossing back and forth from the left to right while on a walk. The left side is traditionally recommended (and that’s the side to use if you plan to eventually compete in dog sports), but either side will do as long as you stick to it. You can teach your dog to stay on one side by always treating your dog on the side that you want them for that walk. This means your dog will quickly begin to automatically go to that side looking for the treat/reward. If your dog goes to the other side or starts pulling towards something, just get their attention with a treat—lure them back to the side you want them to walk on, then praise and feed the treat.",Managing pulling behavior,"It’s natural for puppies to want to explore their world, which means they’ll probably pull at the end of the leash to try to get something or somewhere. It’s important to not inadvertently reward this behavior by pulling back, or by allowing them to pull their way to where they want to be. Remember that simply continuing to walk is a reward for pulling.

The first step to discourage pulling is to not move forward. When they pull, stop walking until you get slack on the leash, then resume walking. At this stage anything that reinforces the desired action—your dog moving toward you—will help. So, if you’ve been practicing applying mild leash tension as you encourage the dog to come your way (see the “small steps” section), you can use a little tension here as a way of offering more guidance as to what’s expected.

This part can require patience, as your “walk” may not be continuous forward motion.

Tip: Don’t ONLY offer treats after your dog has stopped pulling. Reward them when they haven’t been pulling and are simply near you. If the treat only comes out when the dog has been pulling and then stops, they might see pulling as the thing that initiates the “game.”",Reactivity,"If you see something that is going to be extra challenging for your puppy—like a child playing with a ball, squirrels, or other dogs—give them extra help keeping the focus on you.

First, find ways to keep a distance from things that you know are really hard for your puppy to resist. This will keep them below threshold, meaning they can still focus and take treats. Once your dog is reacting (barking/lunging/etc), they are over threshold and can’t think or learn. To keep distance you may need to cross the street if you see another dog, or pick walking routes that allow you to avoid or keep distance from, say, a basketball court.

When you can, try to get within view of the offending dog or object, but not close enough to trigger a negative reaction, and offer small bits of high value treats to your puppy. The goal is to both keep your puppy’s attention and help them begin to start making positive associations with the thing they are fearful or over-aroused about.

When you’re passing close to triggers, you can also take treats in your hand, bring them right down to your dog’s nose, keep them there until the distraction has passed—and then feed them. By luring your dog through a very distracting situation and keeping their attention on you, you’ll reinforce that paying attention to you is going to be rewarded and help create new associations with whatever they are reactive to.",Why Is My Dog Pulling on the Leash?,"Walking your pup every day is an essential part of dog maintenance. So if you want to learn how to walk a dog properly, you should first understand why your pup is causing you trouble. There’s always a reason behind a doggie’s behavior. Whether it’s uncontrollable barking, pulling on the leash, or toileting on your carpets — understand the trigger, and you can change the pattern.

It Works for Them

Pulling gets dogs where they want to go, and it’s faster than following your pace.

What’s more, it’s a natural behavior in the dog world. In the wild, if a dog is trapped, it’ll pull to try to escape. That’s why some dogs are trained to pull sleds. But long leash dog training is a complex task and requires lots of patience and dedication.

Excitement

Imagine you’ve spent the whole day at home and it’s finally time to go out. And you’ll see all your friends in the park. On top of that, your second favorite person will also be there. I’d want to go as fast as possible.

No wonder our puppies might pull on their leashes out of pure excitement.

Reactivity

Walking a dog on a leash is challenging if you have a drama queen. Such dogs overreact to stimuli that shouldn’t normally cause an issue. It might be falling leaves, birds, or small children.

In time, overlooked reactivity can turn into aggression. In case you notice such behavior in your doggie, contact a dog specialist.

Fear or Anxiety

If you’re leash training an older dog that hasn’t been appropriately trained at a young age, you might notice your pet getting anxious or fearful when it sees the leash. Older dogs learn harder. Anything new can cause them inconvenience.

In this case, you might want to slow down the training and look into calming dog supplements",Training Essentials,"You can’t learn how to leash train a dog without proper equipment. Here’s a list of everything you’ll need:

• Harness or Collar

You can’t start loose-leash training your dog without a good collar. There are hundreds of leash training collars, so the choice is yours.

Still, avoid choke, prong, or shock collars, as these are dangerous and inhumane. Your puppy shouldn’t suffer.

A great collar alternative is a harness. Also, it’s safer for dogs used to pulling on their leashes.

• Leash

There’s no one best dog training leash. Depending on your puppy’s breed, you might want to choose a lightweight one for smaller breeds or a sturdier option for heavy chewers.

For the purpose of leash training, you don’t want a retractable leash. These are a perfect option for dogs that already have established leash walking habits.

• Treats

Positive reinforcement is critical in dog training. This is the practice of rewarding desired behavior with treats and praise instead of punishing unwanted behavior. It’s been proven as the most effective, humane, and enjoyable way of teaching your pup.

So the best way to leash train a dog is with lots of yummy treats.

And why not let your puppy choose them? Go to the pet store with your dog to taste different treats and buy the ones your pup enjoyed the most.

• Patience and Positivity

Training your dog to stay beside you instead of pulling on the leash or walking between your feet can be irritating. Your puppy won’t get it right the first time. But no matter how annoying it can be — it’s not impossible.

Brace yourself with tons of patience and positivity, and enjoy the time you spend with your best friend.

Training your pup to walk next to you is a multi-step process. Take it slow and give your puppy time to adjust and learn."
how to potty train puppies,How long does it take to potty train a puppy?,"Some puppies pick up potty training in six months but it can take longer. Puppies, like most young, learn at their own pace and it is important to be patient, kind, and supportive during potty training.

A puppy’s bladder control depends on his size, breed and age. Smaller breeds need to have increased breaks as their bodies process food and liquids much faster than larger breeds.

From the first day of your pup’s potty training schedule, ensure that you are consistent so that he learns that he goes out after a nap, playtime, food or any activity. Most puppies need potty breaks every couple of hours, regardless of their breed.

10 potty training tips to get you started

• Create a designated space for your puppy using a baby gate to limit his run of the house.

• Recognize your puppy’s pre-bathroom behavior; look out for potty trip indicators such as sniffing or circling.

• Puppies need breaks between 3 to 5 times a day or more.

• Take a puppy outside 20 minutes after any activity, meal and drink.

Get expert tips and news and subscribe to the Petfinder Newsletter.",An Important Rule For Potty Training Your Puppy,"My rule is that the puppy doesn’t have freedom inside the house if she’s not “empty” after she’s been out. Non-empty puppies have to go back into confinement of a crate or X-pen.

If you drop the ball and your puppy has an accident on your oriental rug or bedspread, just quickly make a startling noise like hey! and scoop up the little darling, mid-potty, and rush her outside.

No spanking, no lecturing, no showing her the accident.

Accidents are your fault, not the puppy’s.

If you’re going to lay blame, or smack something with a rolled up newspaper, you’d better smack yourself. The pup doesn’t understand why you would become so violent with her over a normal bodily function. Don’t strain your relationship by making punishment part of your “training.”

Your pup can’t possibly mind-read to find out what you want. So you’re going to show her by communicating in a way she’ll quickly understand.","“I Need To Go, Mom!”","Here’s how to teach her how to “train” you to open the door for her.

• With the puppy sitting, offer a really good treat, just out of her mouth’s reach.• If she tries to grab it, close your fist around it.• Your puppy’s next move will probably be to try to paw at your fist.• When she does, open your hand and give her the treat.

You are rewarding having her “smack” or wave at something.

When she gets the hang of this, and is predictably responding to the hidden treat with a paw swipe, I name it smack.

Then, you can start holding up the bells to try to get the same response.

Kismet caught on to the bells super fast. Being a Boston Terrier, she uses her “hands” readily, so it went quickly.

As soon as she got the behavior, I hung the bells on the door and asked her to ring them each time we went out. Even if she’d already whined or barked in her X-pen to tell me.",Life Is Full Of Rewards For Your Puppy,"Opening the door for her when she rings is a life reward that will reinforce the bell-ringing behavior … because she wants to go outside. It goes pretty quickly, once your puppy learns she can control the door.

Within two days, Kismet’s potty training made remarkable improvement. She would stop in mid-play and run to the door to let me know she had to go potty.

I’ve used clicker training for about 40 years to help with potty training, and I’ve also used bells on the door for many years. My dogs can let me know they need to go out, if I’m in the office on the computer.

This was the first time I’ve incorporated the bells at such an early age … and it helped the potty training immensely.

When I get back to my summer home, I’ll have to rehearse this with her again. She’s never been in that house. So she doesn’t know which doors she can teach me to open for her … using her open sesame bells!

With these two parts – monitoring and communication (and some patience), you will be well on your way to a perfectly potty-trained puppy in no time!"
how to teach a puppy not to bite,What not to do When Your Pup Chews,"If you find your pup biting and chewing on something forbidden, you might first find yourself getting frustrated and angry. Before you act, this is what you should not do when you catch your puppy chewing:

Do not show the damage to your puppy

Do not spank, punish, or scold after the fact of chewing. Your pup is unable to connect the punishment with what he did wrong, even if it was only a couple of minutes ago.

Do not attempt to duct tape or tie a damaged object to your dog, which are both inhumane and have resulted in death

Don’t leave your dog or puppy in a crate for more than 6 hours

Do not muzzle to prevent chewing

Please call our clinic or schedule an appointment today.",What age does a puppy stop biting?,"The easiest thing to do is to allow the mother enough time to teach her puppy to stop biting. Researches carried out regarding the age that a puppy stops biting show that 10 weeks is optimal for a puppy to start puppy bite inhibition training. This is because, at this age, the puppy understands communicating with other dogs. The puppy will benefit taking this long in the litter with the mother and other litter mates as its senses of fear have already developed.

Taking a puppy away from this company before this age could agonize it, and it would find a hard time adapting to any new situations you subject it to. Meanwhile, the puppy also needs to be introduced to other things it will socialize within its lifetime, such as cars, cats and so on. This does not mean isolating it, but you will have an easier time if it learns to not bite from fellow young and mature dogs.

Since you want your puppy to behave well with people of all kinds, strangers, kids, you should have it socialize with these before it is 12 years old. A nicely social puppy will grow up into a fantastic companion, while an antisocial dog will bring all sorts of problems so you can spend a lot of time paying attention to it. Before it gets to three months old, let your puppy meet as many people as possible, maybe a hundred. You should invite as many people as possible to your home to give the puppy a chance to socialize since you will probably not go to the dog parks with it.",How do you train a puppy not to be aggressive?,"In case you are acquiring a puppy from someone else, get as much info about its previous experiences as possible. A dog that is more socialized with other people and dogs will have fewer problems with aggressive behavior towards others.

If you are wondering how to teach a puppy not to bite you, there is a lot of resources out there like braintrainingfordogs.com that can provide these answers for a very affordable investment.

You will need to learn from the dogs as well. As aforementioned, dogs warn the puppy when it bites too hard with a loud squeal.

The squeal, in dog language, means “Ouch, you hurt me”. Over repeated squeals, the puppy finally understands that there is a limit to how much pressure it can place on its jaws when biting. You can do this as well by associating a similar sound that the dog will translate as a squeal in dog language. For instance, if you let out a high pitched and loud enough “Ow!” sound every time the puppy bites, it will understand what that means; “Ouch, that hurt me”. once it starts understanding your language, it might back off whenever you let out a, “Ow!” At this point, ensure that you give it some treats to keep it motivated to learn.

This is the reason you need to let a puppy learn from its peers and fellow dogs so it can start to get the picture.",How do you punish a puppy?,"Really, puppies are supposed to be cute. However, when there is extensive indiscipline such as ruining your favorite shoes and excessive biting in puppies, it’s time for you to parent that puppy and get it back on course. Discipline is not just for kids, and you should start puppy bite inhibition training and inject some discipline in them along the way. Bad puppy behavior is easily punishable if you have the patience, and this way you will give it important life lessons.

One way to punish the puppy is revoking its play time whenever it bites you as you play. With no exceptions, show her that if they bite, its game over. Rather than yell at the puppy or physically hit her, show her that she gets nothing from biting. Whenever you react, she might think that she needs to bite you to get a response from you. Although it sounds strange, dogs love responses from people, so be careful not to make them want a negative response. If you turn away from the puppy and tuck your hands in your armpits, you show the biting puppy in a calming signal that you won’t give them any attention.

Another great way of showing the puppy not to bite is hand feeding it. You can, for instance, smear peanut butter on your palm and have the puppy lick it. It will enjoy licking it. This will teach the puppy that it can only lick at your hands. However, if the little guy tries to bit off your fingers, withdraw your hand and let it see that it cannot do that. As soon as the puppy has calmed down, resume feeding and eventually, it will learn to be gentle with the hand that feeds it.",How Do Dogs Normally Learn Bite Inhibition?,"Most dogs begin learning bite inhibition when they’re puppies. Their littermates and their mother’s nipples are frequently the only live things that end up in a puppy’s mouth during the first couple of months of life.

Since pups erupt teeth around 3 to 4 weeks of age, this is when most dogs begin to learn how and when to use them. This first set of teeth are quite sharp (as any puppy owner can attest), and they are the only real defense nature has provided to these cute balls of fluff.

If the young pups use their teeth on littermates during play, or they get too enthusiastic while nursing, the nipped companion will often whine, yelp, or give some other auditory indication of displeasure. The mother or bitten sibling will then stop interacting with the offending nipper.

This means that the milk bar gets up and walks away from the biting puppy, or the playmate stops the fun game they were playing by refusing to interact or vacating the area.

As social creatures, dogs often consider being ignored or alone unpleasant.

Trainers call situations like these, in which a pooch loses access to something he likes as a result of his behavior, a “negative punishment.”

Puppies raised with their mom and siblings have usually learned the beginnings of bite inhibition by the time they are relocated to a new human family.

But pups raised with no siblings or mother have not been able to try out their jaws and fresh set of teeth on thick-skinned canine companions. This means they usually do not know when and how to use their mouths appropriately.

Pups that are taken home after they’re 8 weeks old have had many more chances to practice their bite inhibition than those who go to new homes at a younger age."
how to stop puppies from biting,Puppy biting & chewing your possessions,"How to stop a puppy biting, let them bite and chew appropriate items instead. Swap for a natural root or coffee wood chew

Puppies chew anything and everything. For them, the world is full of things to test with their teeth, until we show them otherwise. If your puppy has something you’d rather them not get their teeth into, follow this advice:

• Call puppy to you and drop eye contact to encourage them to come right to you• Praise with gentle massages and kindness for recall• Swap items being chewed with a dried treat such as a pizzle or a tree root• Remove your precious shoes or TV controls and step away.• If the above does not seem to work, call your pup and walk away encouraging your pup to come with you• Bend down, Low to the ground, and side-on.

They will then be ready for a rest. leave music softly playing in the background. More on preventing separation anxiety in the links below. Here is a guide about what music is best and how it helps relaxation

During the first week or two, your puppy needs to be weaned off constant company if they are to be happy alone. This helps to get them to relax and sleep with and without you. Too much play and high drive interaction is not conducive to good relaxation and sleep. It also leads to unthinking behaviours and biting.

Pups need a huge amount of sleep. They can do this when we let them be as opposed to entertaining them all the time we are with them. They will also sleep through the night when they get rest during the day. with short sweet, intermittent attention, love, and guidance.

If your puppy is chewing past 4  6 months of age when you are out, this is most likely due to an inability to be alone, look for help below in the separation anxiety link.

Don’t tell them off: We know puppy biting can be really hard and hurt a lot. But getting cross will make your puppy more frustrated, and won’t be so effective at making them learn what we want them to do.

No biting? Reward: In case of any positive interactions that happen where biting isn’t involved – focus on giving them lots of positive feedback and giving them treats.

No rough playing or wrestling: We know there is little that is more fun than playing rough with dogs. But for now, wrestling will definitely increase puppy biting – we couldn’t guarantee it more. Save it for when they’re older!

Keep temptations away: Tie your hair up, and avoid wearing appealing clothes that may encourage your puppy into biting such as  long skirts or swishy trousers. You’ll be able to pick up your fashion sense in no time, don’t worry.

What should I do?,"Hard puppy biting is often linked to frustration and over-arousal (not the kind of naughty arousal – I just mean hyped up). If this happens, go back to the checklist at the beginning and see what can be improved to help your puppy, maybe they need more:

• Sleep: This is a big one. You may need to really enforce nap times and try to get them into a routine – using a crate or playpen is great for this.  • Mental Stimulation: Depending on their breed, they might need to be stimulated differently. Does your terrier need to dig or chase? Maybe your spaniel needs more sniffy games?• Physical Exercise: Low arousal activities that still tire them out are better than high arousal ones which will increase adrenaline – your puppy is way too young to become an adrenaline junkie.• Chew toys: Frozen chew toys (especially with treats inside) are great to give them something crunchy to chew on and soothe those gums.• Training: You might need to go back to the drawing board. Work out what you want your puppy to do instead of biting you (like biting another toy), and train them to do that instead.",Make Playtime Productive,"A puppy lives in a human-dominated world, and, at times, it’s necessary to get on his level to communicate—literally! Interactive play with your new best friend is a great way to stimulate his mind, build a bond and set boundaries. The JW Pet Play Place Butterfly Puppy Teether is a durable toy and useful tool to use when figuring out how to stop a puppy from biting.

When playing with your pup, it’s important to have fun and get to know your furry friend, so that he can understand the mutual relationship. If your puppy nips, or begins eyeing your hand as a chew toy, it’s encouraged to let out a sudden, short yelp, similar to a high-pitched bark. This lets him know that he has bitten down too hard."
when can puppies leave their mom,To Learn Key Social and Behavioral Traits,"Puppies who leave their canine family too early will show immediate behavior problems. They will be fearful of many things and show a lack of confidence. They can also be slow to bond to people or will go the other direction, attaching so strongly to their new owners that they will panic when left alone. The ability to soothe himself, to relax when left alone, is missing with most of these puppies.

Biting is common. The mother dog teaches the puppy to control his biting as do the puppy’s littermates. When puppies go to their new home, some biting is to be expected, as all puppies experiment. But when deprived of these early lessons, the puppy will bite more and harder, and teaching him that biting is not allowed is more difficult.

Puppies who are removed too early won’t know how to act with other puppies or dogs, and because they act differently, other dogs will react badly to these puppies. Since their mother didn’t have the chance to teach the puppy how to be a dog, he will always be socially inept.",Taking Puppies Too Young is Illegal In Some States,"In 26 states, the age at which puppies may be separated from the mother dog or sold is defined by law. Of those, 22 say that puppies must be eight weeks old before they can be sold. Three states—Wisconsin, Virginia, and Maine—require that puppies must be seven weeks old.

Some states focus on the age that a puppy can be separated from his mother. Illinois, for example, requires that a puppy be at least eight weeks old before he can be taken from his mother.

The laws vary as to who these laws apply to, with some focusing on dog breeders, kennels, and other commercial facilities. Other laws apply to anyone selling puppies, including those on Craigslist.

Before buying any puppy, the more you know the better. If an unscrupulous person produces puppies and knows that he can sell them early at six to seven weeks (or earlier) and avoid paying for food, veterinary care, or other costs, then that cycle will continue. But if more people say no, then perhaps that cycle of human behavior can be changed.

According to veterinarian and behaviorist Dr. Sally Foote, the socialization period in puppies typically lasts from between 6 and 12-to-14 weeks of age.

During this time, puppies are learning the norms of the world around them, and they develop attitudes and behaviors they’ll keep as adult dogs. The American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior says this is when puppies should be exposed to as many new people, animals, stimuli, and environments as can be achieved safely and without causing over stimulation.

Socialization of a puppy during this period has a huge effect on the behaviors, confidence, and attachments the dog will have throughout his lifetime. It’s also the time when the puppy will form a strong bond with the humans taking care of him.",Learning From Littermates,"Puppies also have what some animal behaviorists call a primary socialization period, which begins as they become more aware of the world around them at 3-to-5 weeks of age. Through their mother and littermates, puppies begin to learn appropriate play behaviors and how to communicate with and relate to other dogs.

They also learn rudimentary impulse control and bite inhibition from the feedback of their siblings and mother.

Research has shown that puppies removed from their litters very early are more likely to display problems in behavior and temperament when they’re grown, including being fearful, aggressive, or anxious; guarding their food and toys; and being highly reactive and more difficult to train.

On the other hand, puppies that stay with their littermates for too long may start to develop dominant or submissive behaviors that can also lead to problems."
when do puppies start losing their teeth,When Do Puppies Lose Their Baby Teeth?,"Puppies first develop their baby teeth (also referred to as deciduous teeth or milk teeth) at around 3 weeks, and by 6 to 8 weeks your puppy will have his full set of milk teeth.

However, pups don’t have their baby teeth for very long. After just a month, your puppy’s milk teeth will begin to fall out, making way for adult dog teeth.

This means your puppy will likely begin to lose his puppy teeth at around 3 to 4 months old, although it can vary between breeds. Not coincidentally, this is roughly the same time frame in which puppies can begin eating puppy food, rather than milk.

This is around the time when most owners will have finally taken their puppy home. As your pup’s baby teeth fall out and adult teeth begin to emerge, you’ll want to make sure you’re providing your puppy with teething toys and relief.

Your pup should have a full set of adult teeth at around 6 to 9 months of age. Once your dog’s adult teeth have grown in and he is safely out of the crazy teething phase, you can begin considering more heavy duty chew toys.

When puppies first begin to teethe, you may notice drops of blood on their toys, or even little baby teeth that have fallen out! Don’t worry — it’s normal and nothing to worry about.

There was one occasion a while back, where I was dog sitting a young puppy and playing tug of war with her. As we were playing, one of her teeth popped right out! I didn’t know anything about dog teething and so was quite a bit panicked (especially when she began to bleed a little), but the owner assured me that she was in the process of growing in her big dog teeth!

It’s best to avoid being too rough with your pup’s mouth during this period. Games like tug of war should be avoided, since it could potentially affect the growth of new teeth.

You’ll also notice that your puppy will get quite mouthy while teething – even more than usual! This is when you’ll want to make sure you’re providing your pup with plenty of pup-appropriate chew toys while teaching him that nipping isn’t OK (even if his little teeth are bugging him).

Have you had experience with your dog losing puppy teeth? Ever seen a tooth or two pop loose unexpectedly? Lose any particularly precious possessions in the name of canine chompin’?

Share your story in the comments!",When does a puppy’s baby teeth start to grow in?,"Typically, a puppy’s first teeth start to grow in as early as two weeks, but some experience this a few weeks later. You will notice that they are beginning to sprout when your own pupper starts teething if you have him early enough. Be warned that this will be a frustrating experience, so you need to exercise a lot of patience at this time. When your puppy is teething, you will notice several of these things:

• The puppy is drooling.

• Spots of blood appear on his toys.

• The pup is chewing on other things that he probably should not be (more than usual).

If you are with your doggo when he begins to teethe, here is what you can do:

• Get him some teething toys. These will be soothing to the teeth and gums while giving him a safe outlet to chew something without it harming him or your possessions. (If you need to know where to get one, look here.)

For more tips on surviving the puppy teething phase, check out this list of tips!",When does a puppy’s baby teeth begin to fall out?,"If your pup is like most other dogs, he should begin to shed his baby dog teeth/primary teeth at around four months of age. At this point, he should have a total of 28 baby teeth. Gently check inside your dog’s mouth. If he has less or more than normal, you should see a vet as this could be a sign of other medical issues in young puppies.

As Fido’s baby teeth fall out, they are being replaced by adult canine teeth. At the end of this phase, he should have 42 adult teeth in total! In between these two results, you should look for signs that your precious pup is growing out of his old chompers!

• You might find tiny little sharp teeth on the floor as you pass by. This is normal; it isn’t like a puppy can put his teeth under a pillow and wait for the Tooth Fairy! He will just leave them where they lie and continue to go about business as usual.

• Your puppy will be in some teething pain when their puppy teeth are almost ready to fall out. Again, that is normal. Just like babies get fussy throughout the teething phase, puppies will be, too. He may bite on random objects (or your fingers) more than usual, paw or lick at his jaw, or whine for attention. Give him soothing toys to chew on, or some peanut butter to suck on. If the pain seems to be out of proportion to the pain he should be experiencing, go to a vet. Something else may be going on that you can’t see.",What to do when your puppy is not losing teeth on time,"Okay, so your pup is not losing his teeth when he should or like he should be. In this case, the first thing you do is go to your regular veterinarian. Always do that when in doubt! From there, they will be able to help you find the underlying cause of the delay. Of course, the pup could just be a late bloomer, but something else may be at play. This includes:

• Double teeth. When the baby teeth are being pushed out, the adult teeth can sometimes grow in right behind them. This is normal except for when the baby tooth does not fall out. When this happens, your puppy may need to have his tooth manually extracted. That is no fun, but it’s necessary if you want his teeth to be healthy later on.

Don’t worry too much; most of the time, a pup’s adult teeth will come in without any complications! Even if they do, a vet can help and get you back on track in no time."
what do puppy teeth look like when they fall out,Puppy Teeth Stages,"First, puppies’ incisors come in first.  They will get six incisors on the top and another six on the bottom.  Puppies will keep those incisors until they are between twelve and sixteen weeks old.

Around the twelve to sixteen-week mark, the baby incisor roots will dissolve, and those teeth fall out.

They are then replaced by the permanent incisor teeth that they will have for the rest of their lives.

Next, four canine teeth will come in.    Those baby canines will last until a puppy is sixteen to twenty-four weeks old.  Like their incisors, the roots will also dissolve so that the baby teeth can fall out and be replaced by their permanent teeth.

Finally, puppies will get twelve premolars that will come in right behind their canine teeth.  Premolars last until a puppy is around five to seven months old.

The roots of premolars are thicker than those of the incisor and canine teeth, they also come in as the last of the puppy teeth.  For that reason, they are the last of the puppy teeth to fall out.  Once these premolars fall out, they will also be replaced by permanent teeth.

The twenty-eight puppy teeth that a dog has from the age of four weeks until about seven months will be replaced by for that twenty-eight permanent teeth though.  As an adult, once all of their permanent teeth come in an adult dog is expected to have forty-two permanent teeth in all.",Puppy Baby Teeth,"Just like human children, puppies have a small set of milk teeth, and a larger set of adult teeth.

Unlike human children, who have 20 milk teeth, puppies have an impressive 28 milk teeth! Adult dogs have 42 teeth on average.

Puppies’ first teeth start to come through the gums when they are between two and four weeks old.

If you are buying your puppy from a breeder they will still be with their mom at the breeder’s home at this point.

Most puppies have all their baby teeth by the time they’re six weeks old.

Because they don’t need to do any tough chewing yet, puppies don’t have any molars amongst their baby teeth.

That means all those little milk teeth are capable of delivering a sharp nip!",Puppy Teething Toys,"Virtually every teething puppy (in fact every teething animal, as any owner of a human baby knows) will have a desperate urge to chew on things.

Chewing helps push the adult teeth through the gums, and the sensation provides relief from the discomfort of teething.

To help your puppy gain pain relief by chewing without them becoming destructive in the home, provide them with some specially designed puppy teething toys.

It’s smart to choose toys specifically designed for teething puppies because the materials will be softer than adult toys (for weaker jaws), and ultra durable (so they can withstand a lot of chewing with shedding fragments that could harm your puppy).

We think the best puppy teething toys are this puppy teething stick from KONG, or on the days when your heart really goes out to them, there’s this one you can fill with treats, also from KONG.

You can read our review of Puppy KONG toys over here.",Brushing Puppy Teeth: Setting your puppy up for a healthy future,"As a rule, dogs don’t need to have their teeth brushed as often as we need to brush ours.

That’s because they have far less sugar and tooth decay-causing foods in their diet than we do.

For the most part, chewing on kibble and dog toys will keep their teeth clean.

However, if they are prone to plaque, tartar or bad breath as they grow up, you might discover a bit of help with dental hygiene is exactly what they need.

And your grown up dog is more likely to cooperate with having their teeth cleaned if you have familiarized them with it as a puppy.

From the time you bring them home, gradually get them used to having their mouth touched, inside and out.

A great way to start is by letting them lick peanut butter or the gravy from wet food off your finger.

Once they are doing that happily, try running your finger over their teeth and gums once your finger is clean.

From here you can introduce a finger toothbrush or handled toothbrush.

If you think your dog could benefit from toothpaste too, ask your vet to reccomend a suitable brand and cleaning routine.",When do puppies start losing their teeth?,"Puppies get their baby (also called “milk”) teeth pretty early on, usually around five to six weeks of age.

By 12-16 weeks, which is right about when you should be welcoming your puppy into your home and family, these little temporary teeth start falling out and adult teeth begin to replace them.

At about 24 weeks (six months) of age, most puppies have lost all their baby teeth and their adult teeth will be in place; by eight months, they should be fully grown in.

The AKC notes that the six-month mark as a great time to check your puppy’s mouth to make sure all the baby teeth have fallen out and that the adult teeth are coming in straight, uncracked, and unbroken.

If you think there may be an issue in there, get it straightened out with your veterinarian. Early detection and treatment can save you and you puppy a lot of grief later on.

This is also a great time to begin acclimating your puppy to tooth-brushing. Read our guide on dog teeth brushing here."
why is my puppy breathing so fast,Normal Breathing in dogs,"We hope that you all remember from biology class that breathing in brings oxygen into our lungs, swapping it with carbon dioxide to be expelled. The oxygen goes round the body to our cells, providing them with energy to function, producing more CO2 as a waste product. Without this critical action, we pretty much cease to function… we die!

Our bodies are pretty good at knowing what they want. Special receptors in arteries and on the brainstem called chemoreceptors detect the levels of CO2 and O2 , and the blood’s pH (acidity) constantly. When our bodies are metabolising (producing energy) fast, such as during exercise, we use up oxygen and produce more carbon dioxide. Increased carbon dioxide leads to a drop in the pH of the blood – it becomes more acidic. So if the chemoreceptors detect low blood pH and O2, and high CO2, they tell the lungs and associated muscles to work faster (tachypnoea or breathing fast). This brings oxygen into and CO2 out of our bodies more quickly, restoring balance. Once the levels are normal, the receptors tell the lungs to slow down again.

So why is your puppy breathing fast? Probably because its chemoreceptors have detected low O2 and blood pH, and high CO2, and are compensating. Question answered!

Well, we hope you enjoyed this article about…",Normal Causes,"There are plenty of normal reasons why your puppy might be breathing fast. As mentioned above, the most likely reason is exercise. If a puppy has been running around all afternoon, its body will have a huge demand for oxygen to supply the hard-working cells, and a lot of CO2 to remove. Breathing fast will help correct this quickly.

Stress, excitement or fear are all linked to the stress hormone cortisol. Also known as the fight-or-flight hormone, when it activates it increases the heart rate. As the heart is a muscle, it needs oxygen to function. A faster heart leads to tachypnoea as the lungs compensate to bring more O2 to the heart. Has your puppy just had a fright or gotten excited? This might be the cause of the fast breathing rate. Cortisol is also responsible for an increased breathing rate due to pain. If your puppy sadly hurts themself, they may breathe faster.

Finally, the lungs have a secondary function of helping to cool the body down by expelling warm air and inhaling cooler air. As dogs only sweat through their feet and noses, the lungs are particularly important in regulating heat. Heat is produced secondarily to exercise or just because of the environment – if your puppy is too hot, it will pant fast to lose some of that heat. Be especially wary of exercising puppies on hot days, as the two heat sources can overwhelm their compensation mechanisms and lead to heatstroke – heatstroke can be fatal, especially in puppies, so always help them cool down if they are panting too hard. A fever due to illness can cause rapid breathing for the same reason.",Heart Diseases,"The heart is closely linked to the lungs. It pumps blood to the lungs, allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to be exchanged. If the heart isn’t doing its job properly, the lungs sometimes have to compensate by breathing faster. Most heart diseases in puppies are present from birth – developing heart disease at such a young age is rare.

The developing heart undergoes a lot of changes before a puppy is born. However, sometimes these changes go wrong or don’t take place, resulting in congenital heart malformations, such as narrow vessels, holes in the heart or leaky valves. These cause the blood to flow in the wrong direction, or the heart to have to work harder against pressure. The result is excessive strain on the heart. We can sometimes hear these defects with a stethoscope as a heart murmur. Only the most serious heart defects cause disease and tachypnoea as a puppy – many will either cause no effects or result in disease later in life.  Puppies with heart disease may have soft coughs and be very lethargic.",Why Pups May Breathe Fast,"There are several instances where you may catch your puppy breathing rapidly. Some of these instances may appear to be no-brainers, and shouldn’t ever be cause for alarm. For instance, if your pup has just spent the last half-hour playing vigorously in warm temperatures, he may be simply panting as a means to catch his breath.

Other instances where you catch your pup breathing quickly may need a little more explanation because they may strike you as a bit odd. For instance, you may catch rapid breathing with the little guy is asleep. You may even see him start breathing rapidly when he’s just sitting there, idling, without any prior exercise.

The good news here is that in most of the cases involving rapid breathing, you don’t have a thing to worry about. However, it’s wise to know about the handful of scenarios where rapid puppy breathing could be a cause for alarm well before they arrive, so you’ll know how to handle things with a cool head.",Rapid Puppy Breathing and Sleeping,"A sleeping puppy can look adorable for obvious reasons. But when he starts breathing rapidly, he may look like he’s in trouble. This appearance may be augmented by other body motions the pup may be experiencing during slumber, like twitching, wriggling, or whining.

Thankfully, you have nothing to worry about here. Rapid breathing – and the other physical behaviors – are simply what puppies do when they fall asleep. In fact, this type of rapid breathing is similar to what you may see in an infant as they try to catch some “Zs.”

The reason for the breathing and movements is because the puppies are dreaming. While we don’t know what pups dream about, we can extrapolate from our own experiences in the dreamscape to surmise that they are experiencing some exciting, scary, and some flat-out trippy things. Their bodies are going to react in kind.

We may get worried over rapid breathing during sleep because pups do a whole lot of slumbering. But it’s necessary for them to sleep so much, because sleep is the time where their bodies grow and develop. Dreaming – and the rapid breathing that stems from it – is merely a by-product of this important process."
when do puppies start walking,Puppy Development – Week Four,"Week four is when puppies really start to develop into individual dogs. They will look like a young version of their older self, rather than being identical to their littermates and almost indistinguishable from one another. This is the stage when they are not only walking around but playing with their brothers and sisters. You may hear some attempts at growling between puppies. This isn’t aggressive growling and the youngsters are just developing their skills in a safe environment.

By the end of week four, your puppy will have developed a lot thanks to the time it spends with its siblings and pushing boundaries with mum. Not only will a four-week-old puppy be walking, but it will start running and even wagging its tail.

Other areas of development include feeding. Four to five-week old puppies will try some solid food, although it can take some getting used to. They will seek out some privacy when pooping, moving away from the rest of the litter to do so, and their mums will take this as an indication that they are no longer needed to clean up the mess afterward – cue the breeder’s involvement.",At What Age Do Puppies Start To Walk?,"Dogs can stand on their legs relatively quickly. After only 2 or 3 weeks of age, puppies should be able to stand up fairly well. Of course, every companion will develop his physical abilities at his own pace depending on his breed, health, and many other elements. Nonetheless, most puppies will start walking around 3 or 4 weeks. After learning how to walk, they become more independent and start to explore the world!

Here’s a video as visual support to see when puppies are starting to walk!

How To Help Your Pup To Start Walking?

Your companion could have some difficulty taking his first steps alone. In this case, you can help him by giving him better odds to stand up. For example, slippery floors will make it complicated for puppies to walk without any traction. Thus, providing your young companion with blankets or rugs could be very useful to help him start walking!

There’s another good article about when do puppies start walking on the Cuteness blog! [Link Open In a New Tab]

A puppy is usually adopted between 7 to 9 weeks of age. That’s why you probably won’t have the chance to see the first steps of your pooch. On the other hand, it’s more fun because puppies will be ready to walk, play, and run around 8 weeks old!",Why Walking With Your Puppy Is Important?,"Before letting you go, I want you to understand the reasons why daily walks are important for dogs. Like humans, they will need regular physical activity to stay healthy. Your pup’s exercise needs will depend on his breed, age, and several other conditions. However, every dog should have at least one (or preferably two) walk per day around 15 to 20 minutes. This simple habit will provide your buddy with the basic physical and mental activity he needs!

Very young puppies are one of the few exceptions that won’t be able to enjoy daily walks. Otherwise, walking with your dog is crucial for his well-being. Besides, this activity can be very fun and good for you. This moderate activity will allow both of you to benefit from better physical and mental health. In other words, there’s no reason to not walk every day with your puppy if he’s older than 16-18 weeks and vaccinated!",Last Thoughts About Walking With Puppies!,"Finally, there are many things you need to understand to take care of your puppy properly. As you will see, he won’t be small and cute for very long, so you must enjoy his youth. Whether your companion is young or old, I’m sure you will have plenty of fun with him. When your puppy has become an adult, it’s the best time to start dog sports or other fun activities with him!

Keep in mind that every dog will grow at his own pace. Thus, there’s nothing to be scared about if your furball doesn’t follow the general development timeline. It’s the same thing to know if he’s ready to walk with you. Some pups will take more or less than 16-18 weeks to be able to hit the streets with you safely. I hope this article helps you to understand better when puppies start to walk. Now, you should go play with your pooch to keep him fit, healthy, and happy!

Should You Let Your Dog Sniff On Walks?

Does Walking Help Your Dog To Lose Weight?",When do puppies start walking after birth?,"Your puppy will start to mature as soon as his or her eyes open after birth. This normally happens between one to two weeks after birth.

For the first two weeks of his life, your puppy will waddle on his belly (a bit like belly surfing on a board). While he’s doing this, he’s constantly building up his leg muscles.

At around two weeks old, your puppy will start to stand although his first few attempts will be wobbly (just like a human baby when they first try to stand). The stronger he gets, the more active he’ll become – this means walking isn’t too far off now!

By three weeks old, your puppy will want to get out of his nest and explore the big wide world. This is when you’ll notice him (and all his siblings) trying to crawl out of their whelping box. He’ll also be climbing all over his mother for entertainment!

If you want to keep all the puppies in one place, this is a good time to get a large play or exercise pen, so they’re kept contained.

By the time your puppy is four weeks old, he’ll be able to walk with a wobbly gait. As the weeks go by, he’ll gain more strength and confidence with his walking after birth.

Should a puppy be walking at 4 weeks?

Puppies should be walking by the age of 4 weeks old. If your puppy is not following these typical milestones I detailed above, then it would be a good idea to have the vet check him out. They should also have developed their own little barks at 7 weeks and up."
do puppy teeth fall out,Puppy Teething Symptoms,"So how can you tell if your puppy is teething? Once your pup is 3 or 4 months old, keep an eye out for these puppy teething symptoms:

•  Blood on Toys: Don’t freak out if you spot a little blood on your puppy’s fave chew toys — it’s normal and won’t hurt them.

•  Dog-Version of Baby Teeth: Just like with human babies, your fur babies teeth fall out as they begin the teething process — it’s normal. You may find them stuck to toys or whatever else they’ve been chewing. They lose 28 baby teeth in all over a period — some you may see, others not.

•  Increased Chewing: Chewing is a natural instinct for dogs, but for many puppies, teething can put that impulse into overdrive. That’s because chewing can be a self-soothing behavior for teething puppies — but it can also put your belongings at risk. There are some expert strategies below to save your shoes.

Other puppy teething symptoms include:

• Increased drooling

• Hesitating to eat

• Eating slowly

• Whining

• Running a low fever

• Red and/or swollen gums",When to Call Your Vet,"For most puppies, teething is mildly uncomfortable — but routine. Sometimes, though, a call to the vet might be necessary. You’ll want to watch for these signs of teething troubles. If you spot these issues, give your vet a call.

• Trouble eating

• Rubbing at the mouth

• Dropping food from the mouth while eating

• Reluctance to eat or chew

• Odor from the mouth

Toy breeds in particular seem prone to “double teeth,” says Dr. Eldredge. “The retained baby teeth can cause problems for the developing adult teeth,” she says. “They may totally block the eruption of the adult tooth, leading to a very sore and swollen gum area.” A vet might suggest deciduous tooth removal happens at the same time as a dog’s spay or neuter procedure since they both require general anesthesia.

As a pet parent, you can help during this transition by providing appropriate dog toys, introducing dental health habits, and watching out for signs of trouble. And if your couch or your favorite shoes become a casualty of puppy teething, well, they weren’t nearly as cute as your adorable pup anyway.",Puppy Tooth That Didn’t Fall Out,"Just like in humans, a dog’s puppy teeth should fall out when their adult teeth erupt. Sometimes, the puppy teeth do not fall out, and we refer to them as “retained deciduous teeth”.

Retained baby teeth can occur in any breed. However, we see it most commonly in smaller breeds. It is important to remove these teeth as soon as it becomes evident that they are not going to fall out on their own (usually around 6 months).

In this particular case of a 6 month old male dachshund, I removed the single retained baby tooth at the same time that I neutered the pup, so that the little guy only had to have one anesthesia.

The reason it is so important to remove these teeth, is that they are usually right up against the adult tooth. The close space between the teeth is a great place for food and debris and hair to get stuck. Then the bacteria start growing. Before you know it, you have a severely diseased adult canine tooth. This is a source of pain and infection for the dog.",A Helpful Puppy Teething Timeline: How Long Will It Last?,"The puppy teething stage generally lasts 3 – 5 months and is different for every individual puppy. You’ll want to begin watching a dog for the signs of teething in month 3 of their life until about month 8.

Puppy Teeth Come in At 6 to 8 Weeks Old

Your puppy’s first baby teeth, also called deciduous teeth, come in between six and eight weeks of age.

Since this happens before you bring him home, you won’t have to deal with this. However, those baby teeth only last a few months before his adult teeth break through the gums. This can cause as many problems for your puppy as it does for human children when they’re teething. It’s a tough time for both the puppy and her owners.

Puppies Lose Their Incisors (Front Teeth) In Month 3

Puppies will begin losing baby teeth and growing their adult teeth at an individual rate.

However, most puppies begin losing their incisors (those tiny teeth at the front of the mouth) during the puppy’s third month, often towards the end of the third month. These lost incisors will let you know teething has started.

Puppies Will Continue to Lose Back Teeth From Months 4 to 8

The teething then moves from front to back. The canine teeth (the fangs) usually fall out next, followed by the premolars and then molars. However, it’s not unusual for the fangs to remain as the premolars fall out. Between six to eight months, your puppy should have all 42 adult teeth.",Puppies Will Continue to Lose Back Teeth From Months 4 to 8,"The teething then moves from front to back. The canine teeth (the fangs) usually fall out next, followed by the premolars and then molars. However, it’s not unusual for the fangs to remain as the premolars fall out. Between six to eight months, your puppy should have all 42 adult teeth.

While every pup is different, there are several common signs that your puppy might be at the phase in which he or she will be growing adult teeth soon. Below is a helpful list to be aware of:

• Finding spots of blood on their toys• Literally finding tiny puppy teeth around the house• More than usual desire to chew everything• Increased drooling• Changing in pace of eating (slowing down)• Red and swollen gums• Sometimes running a low-grade fever• Whining• Soft stools• Upset stomach"
how long can puppies hold their pee,How Long Can Your Puppy “Hold It”?,"Adult dogs generally need to pee between three to five times a day. But puppies need breaks much more often!

Generally, puppies can hold it for one hour per every month of age (so a three-month-old puppy can wait three hours to pee). Here are common time limits for puppies of different ages:

• 8–10 weeks: One hour or less. Puppies this young simply can’t hold their urine for more than an hour, and even that is pushing it, sometimes! You might start crate training at this age, but you can’t leave a young puppy in a crate for long periods; they’ll wet their bed (a lot!)• 10–12 weeks: Bladder capacity is increasing, but two hours is still the longest that most puppies can hold it at this stage.• 3–6 months: At this point, consider the one hour per month rule. Three-month-old puppies can wait for three hours, four-month-old puppies for four hours, and so on.• After 6 months: An older puppy, like most adult dogs, has the ability to hold it for up to six hours. If you don’t have a dog door, be sure to pop home at lunch or get your pet sitter to pay a visit if you’re unable to do so.

Of course, the above estimates can vary depending on a puppy’s size, health, and habits. But any dog forced to hold their urine for too long is at risk for urinary tract infection, stones, or crystals. Plus, holding urine for too long is just plain uncomfortable, and can lead to accidents.",How Long Can You Leave a Puppy Alone in a Crate?,"Wondering how to crate train a puppy, and how long you can leave your puppy alone in the crate? Professional dog trainer Shoshi Parks provides the full scoop on how to crate train a puppy, which you can read here.

To sum it up, crate training is important—but start out slow. Introduce your dog to the crate the first time with treats, and don’t close them in. Give them playtime in and near the crate. Then gradually build up to 10–15 minute intervals of crate time, sticking with these short periods of time until your doggie has adjusted.

When your puppy can tolerate the shorter amount of time, leave them alone in the crate for increasing periods of time. Eventually, your dog will become comfortable there.

You’ll want to be home while initially crate training; don’t leave a young dog alone in a crate for the whole workday. (This would also be a long time for an older dog!) Be sure to give your new family member lots of attention and love when they’re not confined.

Maximum daily time recommended in a crate, by age:

• 8–10 weeks: 30–60 minutes• 11–14 weeks: 1–3 hours• 15–16 weeks: 3–4 hours• 17+ weeks: 4–5 hours (though please don’t resort to this often!)

As your dog gets older, they can be kept in the crate for longer periods of time. But keep in mind, it should always be used as a short-term solution. It’s important that your dog gets lots of exercise and human interaction.",Puppy-Proofing Your Home,"Even if you’ll be home with your pup often, it’s important to get your home ready for those busy little paws and that curious nose (and mouth). Pet parents who thoroughly puppy-proof report fewer problems at home!

For the hours that you leave your puppy alone, consider a “puppy zone.” Choose a secure area of your home, whether it’s the entire living room, a bedroom, or a small portion of the kitchen sectioned off. Here’s what you’ll need:

• A crate if you’re crate training.• Baby gates! This pet gate is a fun, freestanding choice if your dog isn’t a jumper. If they are, you’ll need something higher.• Cozy items like blankets or your old shirts.• At least one bed like this orthopedic pet mattress. Or, you may need a chew-proof bed.

If your dog has learned sleeping well through the night, he won’t need as many potty breaks as he would during the day.

After all: its metabolism slows down and feces and urine are not produced in as much quantity as they are during the day. So, in most cases, the answer to the question: how long can a dog hold its bladder overnight is about 6-8 hours.

Again: this is applicable to pets that have learned to sleep through the night. A younger puppy tends to miss its mom and littermates and could need more frequent potty breaks at night.

Have your pet go potty once before settling down for the night. You can take him outside after his last meal for the day or provide him with the dog pee pads and teach him to relieve himself on them. This can simplify potty training considerably.

If you are still wondering how many toilet breaks does a puppy need, then that first entails answering the question of how long can a dog hold its pee and poo?

The goal of housetraining a puppy is to bring down the number of toilet breaks during the day and especially at night.

Granted – potty training a dog can be a chore, especially at night. But you can greatly reduce that chore by being disciplined from the beginning and by using the best dog pee pads.

After all; dogs can get UTI from holding their pee in too long. So, for the sake of your pet’s health, we recommend at least four elimination rounds during the day (and one or two at night). This number can be increased to 5-6 for small breeds.

In addition, you can learn some useful tips here when your dog accidentally pees on your carpet.

Puppyhood Is The Best Time To Consider Pet Insurance

As a puppy, your dog has probably not shown any significant health concerns. Since pet insurance companies do not cover pre-existing conditions, the younger your dog is when you signup, the better coverage you’ll receive throughout their lifetime. Further, pet insurance can help support you financially during the unpredictable puppy years when dogs are more likely to chew on things they shouldn’t and run into dangerous situations.

So you think you’ve got your puppy house trained, but then they have an accident. There are a few reasons this might occur:

• Too Young – Dogs younger than 12 weeks haven’t developed bladder or bowel control yet.• House Training Not Complete – They aren’t quite there yet and may not know how to tell you that they need to go out.• Regressing Is Real – Some puppies fall back in their progress, so remember to be patient with them.

how many shots do puppies need,How do puppy vaccines work?,"Vaccines give puppies the defense they need to fight disease-causing microorganisms. Vaccines contain antigens – which look like disease-causing organisms to your puppy’s immune system – and are designed to not make your dog sick.

Even though your dog doesn’t get the disease itself, their immune system still produces a response. That way, if they do come into contact with disease-causing organisms in the future, their immune system is more prepared to fight them off. In short, puppy vaccines work the same as vaccines of other species including kitten vaccines and human vaccines.

Puppies typically begin receiving their vaccinations around six weeks of age, with booster shots at intervals of two to four weeks, until they are approximately four months of age. The timing of puppy vaccinations is extremely important.  This is because puppies receive protective antibodies through their mothers’ milk after they’re born, providing temporary immunity.  As this immunity wanes, the vaccination (i.e. parvovirus vaccine) immunity can pick up where mom’s antibodies left off.

Once this immunity begins to decline, puppies should be already off to a great start with their vaccination schedule in order to develop their own long-lasting immunity against infectious diseases.",Risks of vaccines for puppies,"As with all medical procedures, there are some risks associated with puppy vaccinations, but they’re extremely minor compared to the benefits of preventing illness and the transmission of disease.

Very few puppies have serious adverse reactions to vaccines. Some puppies may experience mild side effects after vaccination, similar to humans. These side effects can include loss of appetite, localized swelling at the injection site, or malaise. Generally, these symptoms occur shortly after the initial vaccination and subside fairly quickly.

If your puppy experiences longer lasting symptoms, or more serious reactions, such as vomiting, hives, swollen face, or anything that gives cause for concern, you’ll want to contact your veterinarian immediately.",Preventive care and insurance can help,"Vaccines protect the pets we love and are a crucial part of preventative dog care. But just like humans, our dogs can still get sick.

Some veterinarians give a combination vaccine, while others give each shot individually. Here is a look at the most common puppy vaccination schedule:

how much is a german shepherd puppy,German Shepherd Puppy Price,"These puppies are highly sought after so breeders often place a big price tag to these precious pups.

So just how much do German Shepherds cost?

If you are buying a puppy from a breeder you can expect to pay anywhere from $600-$1500.

The average price of a German Shepherd puppy is $1000.

As a general rule reputable breeders tend to charge higher prices because they put more time, effort, and money into caring for their breeding dogs and puppies.

It will cost breeders around $8,000 to care for their litter, and show litters can cost breeders around $24,000 to raise for the first 8 weeks of their life.

This may seem like a huge amount of money but this budget covers lots – vet expenses, care for the pregnant mother, food, necessary genetic/medical testing, and all other necessary supplies.

When you are looking to purchase a puppy do not be tempted to go to a low-cost pet store or search for the cheapest puppies online to save money.

These puppies tend to suffer from health concerns and are often bred in very poor conditions.

They often come from puppy mills (or are produced by backyard breeders) who are more concerned with making a profit than providing you with a healthy and loving companion.

Whilst they might be cheaper to buy they will cost you a lot of money in the long run with medical and vet fees.",German Shepherd Dog Price,"Although many people crave the adorableness of a puppy they do not consider the amount of time these bundles of energy require.

Purchasing a puppy is very similar to welcoming a newborn into your home.

You will likely lose out on a lot of sleep and will have to diligently train them. You will have to put up with peeing in the house and chewing during their teething phase!

If you want to skip the loveable yet chaotic puppy years then adoption is an incredible option.

When you choose to rescue a dog from a shelter you are giving them a home and most importantly a second chance.

There are millions of dogs in need of homes so strongly consider adopting rather than purchasing a puppy.

Adult German Shepherds from shelters typically cost $50-$300 and these dogs are often spayed/neutered, vaccinated and sometimes even micro chipped so you will not have to worry about those extra expenses.

Adopting an adult dog is much cheaper than buying a puppy and there are also other benefits.

• Shelter workers can answer questions about the dog’s temperament and personality much more accurately than a breeder who cannot guarantee the personality of a young pup.• They will likely be house trained.• You also get the added benefit of saving a life.",German Shepherd Service Dog Price,"Because of their hard-working demeanor they are a common choice for K9 police work or military work.

These dogs are focused and have an incredible amount of strength which makes them perfect for any job which they are trained for.

Dogs that are chosen for these positions are bred very carefully.

Breeders must carefully choose their parents for the perfect temperament and puppies begin training from a very early age.

There is an immense attention to detail that is required to raise a German Shepherd service dog.

This means you have to pay a lot for one of them.

Typically these dogs are sold for $10,000-$20,000 each.

A price like that guarantees you will have a diligent worker for their entire lifetime. In addition you will have to pay for on-going training throughout their life (more on this later).",How much is a German Shepherd puppy?,"German Shepherd Dogs are an extremely popular breed in the US – the American Kennel Club lists these dogs as the #3 breed in 2020 (only surpassed by the Labrador Retriever and the French Bulldog). They are one of the dog breeds that every child can recognize and name – their beauty, loyalty and intelligence makes them wonderful companions and watchdogs.

However, a well-bred German Shepherd is not cheap. The average price for a puppy without papers is $800. While it might be tempting to jump on a “bargain” like this, don’t do it: German Shepherds have a variety of breed-specific health issues. Only responsible breeders who test and select the healthiest dogs for breeding will produce the best puppies. These health-tested and papered puppies will be quite a lot more than $800: Most AKC breeders’ prices for German Shepherd puppies start at $1,500 and can go up as high as $3,000.",How much does it cost a month to own a German Shepherd?,"You should budget at least $90-110 every month for your dog. This will cover the basics: high-quality food and regular vet checks. Some German Shepherd owners spend considerably more money. Professional grooming is necessary for many German Shepherd owners, as these dogs shed heavily. Depending on your location and the type of groomer you choose, a single visit can be as much as $120.

This breeds tends to exhibit several behavioral issues that can be difficult to fix for first-time dog owners, including:

Separation anxietyReactivityHigh prey driveIncessant barkingLeash pulling

Many German Shepherd owners end up taking weekly training lessons, either in a group class or in one-on-one private sessions with a trainer. You can plan to spend anywhere from $80 (for group classes) up to $500 (for private lessons) per month for the ongoing training.

Some German Shepherds are quite destructive and require a lot of chew items and bones in order to not chew up their owners’ furniture. These new chews and toys can quickly become expensive – you might spend $30-100 per month on them."
how much are cane corso puppies,Cost of Adopting a Cane Corso,"Adopting a Cane Corso will almost always be the cheapest option.

On average purebred Cane Corsos less than one year old will be $600, dogs older than one will be “free to a good home” to about $250.

Many times only a small adoption fee is asked for to cover the fee for vaccines.

It is recommended that when adopting you always meet the cane corso you are interested in before purchasing. Adults often have a set temperament and guarding behaviors that can be very difficult to alter.

Cane Corsos have a history of being bred as guard dogs and are still bred for this today. This means that they have been selected for traits that can be very aggressive. Often dogs end up in adoption facilities because they were abandoned due to aggression or guarding issues.

When trained properly, these aggressive traits can be controlled and only expressed when there is a threat to you your family, or your home.

However, sometimes they are not trained properly.

Cane Corsos can unfortunately become aggressive in unpredictable or inappropriate ways. They are often protective and mistrustful of strangers, aggressive towards men and overly defensive of small children.

For these reasons it is very important that you meet the dog first and learn its temperament.

A good adoption center will know the temperament of the dog and can recommend a family based on their lifestyle and dynamic. They will be able to guide you.

Most adoption agencies and shelters will not consider you as a potential home if you have other animals. The Cane Corso’s high prey drive is particularly dangerous for small dog breeds.",Cane Corso Ownership Cost,"Cane Corso’s are giant dogs with lots of energy.

Their size means they are going to require a lot more space, time, care, and food than most breeds.

First of all, let’s acknowledge their sheer size.

Males and female can get up to 26 inches tall on average and usually weigh over 100 pounds. This means they are going to need around five cups of kibble per day. You will tear through about a bag a month on average. Depending on the type of food you buy this can range anywhere from $75-$150 per month.

Food bills are a major part of their monthly cost.

You will also need to have plenty of time each day to take your cane corso for a walk, run, or hike. Dog walking services are also available, but can run to about $20 per 30 minutes of walking time.

Cane Corso’s are a short haired breed, but their coat is double-layered.

Their undercoat will shed throughout the year. Brushing regularly with a rubber brush will keep your home relatively hair free. These types of brushes are typically not expensive (under $25), but the real cost here is time.

Particularly during shedding season in spring, it is recommended that brushing be done at least once a week.

Finally, cane corsos are very strong dogs. They have powerful jaws and love to destroy their toys. Don’t be surprised if you give your new dog a stuffed toy to come home to a whirlwind of fluffy stuffing!

On average Cane Corsos will cost you about $200 a month when factoring in their grooming, food, and toys.",Cost By State,"Breeders will charge more for a puppy the closer you are to a metropolitan area. In general, the more rural the breeder, the lower the price of the puppy will be. This does not mean that the puppies are from a bad genetic stock, it is just a reflection of the difference in the cost of living throughout the US.

The cost of living in metropolitan areas is higher, regardless of state.

Cane corso prices will also vary by state.

By far the most expensive state to buy a Cane Corso puppy is California, prices are $3,000 or more. However there is a much larger variety of kennel club registered puppies in California.

The advantage of traveling to a state like California is that you have more puppies and breeders to compare. You are thereby more likely to pick the puppy that is best for you and your family.

The cheapest state to purchase pups is Texas. Although there seem to be fewer breeders in Texas, there is still significantly more than in other states or regions. The mid-west has the least number of cane corso breeders per capita, followed by the northeastern.

If you live in one of these regions and would like a quality puppy, you may need to travel.

It may seem like a great idea to buy from a different state, especially if you live in an area where Cane Corsos are particularly expensive. But when you factor in the fees of travel and the heath certificate required for state border crossing, it usually is cheaper to buy in your area.

You can see prices by state and region in the table below:",How Much Do Cane Corso Puppies Cost?,"The first thing that you’ll spend money on is the initial price when buying your Cane Corso puppy. For many people, this is (incorrectly) deemed to be the most important expense – but you’ll see later on why this isn’t the case.

On average, you can expect to spend between $1,000 and $2,500 on your Cane Corso puppy. As you can see, this is an extensive price range. This is because many things can affect the price of Cane Corso.

It’s important to note that this price only goes for a pet quality Cane Corso bought from a reputable breeder. Some backyard breeders and puppy mills sell their dogs for as low as $600. Opposite of that, dogs from champion bloodlines can end up costing you $5,000 or even more!

However, it’s important not to let the price of your Cane Corso be the determining factor when deciding on whether you want to buy this dog or not. Just because a dog is more expensive doesn’t necessarily make him a better dog for you. You need to do the proper research first.",Cane Corso Puppies For Sale,"If you’re wondering how much does a Cane Corso cost, it’s important to think about where you want to buy your puppy from.

Prices are not the same in all locations. What we’ve listed is just an average price these big dogs have. The price will greatly depend on whether you’re buying your dog from a reputable breeder or a puppy mill or if you’ve chosen to adopt a dog from a shelter.

When looking for Cane Corso puppies, you shouldn’t be intimidated by the price. As we’ve mentioned, what you don’t pay in the initial fee, you might have to pay later on medical bills.

At the same time, you shouldn’t simply opt to buy the most expensive dog out there. A high price tag is not always a sign of quality."
how much do you feed a puppy,How Much Food Do You Feed a Puppy?,"You should always follow the feeding guidelines on the back of your puppy’s food. Different foods have different caloric contents. Guidelines proclaiming one-size-fits-all feeding amounts for puppies are not correct.

To feed your puppy properly, you need to keep up with their weight and regularly change their feeding amount based on the guidelines on the back of the bag. Of course, you should also shift the amount if your dog grows too thin or too fat. You should not base their feeding amounts on their hunger levels, as many puppies will simply eat until they are bursting.

It is normal for puppies to still ask for food after they’ve already eaten the correct amount. Overfeeding can lead to hip dysplasia and other health issues, so be sure to base your amounts solely on the dog’s body condition and weight.",What is a Good Feeding Schedule for Puppies?,"Generally, puppies should be fed more often than adults. How often depends on the size of the puppy. Very small breeds may need to be fed as much as five times a day. This is because their smaller body sizes make them prone to hypoglycemia, which can cause serious health problems. It is important that they are fed regularly to keep their blood sugar at a normal level.

Larger puppies can be fed less often. Giant breed puppies can be fed about three times a day.

As the dog gets older, you can slowly cut back on feedings until they are being fed about two times a day. We do not recommend feeding dogs any less than this, as it can cause health problems like hypoglycemia and bloat. Very small breeds may still need to be fed three times a day as adults. Otherwise, their blood sugar may not stay at a safe level.",How Do I Know If I’m Feeding My Puppy Enough?,"The easiest way to determine if your puppy is getting enough food is to look at its body condition. You should be able to feel a dog’s ribs. However, you should not be able to see any more than the last two ribs. If your dog’s ribs are poking through their skin, they likely need more food. If fat is building up over their ribs, they are eating too much.

For most breeds, this provides you with an accurate measure of the dog’s current condition. However, for some breeds, it is a bit more complicated than this.

Large breeds may not develop more fat on their ribs. Instead, they may simply start to grow faster. Some owners push their larger dogs to grow bigger and more muscular before they are ready. Growing too fast is the main cause of joint problems like hip dysplasia, however. Your puppy should follow the growth curve that is normal for their breed. If they suddenly start growing too fast, it could be a sign that they are being fed too much.

Some breeds are just skinny as puppies. Greyhounds always appear to be a bit thin, even when they are at a completely healthy weight. If you have a thinner breed, you should aim to keep your puppy on the thinner side.",How Often You Should Feed Your Golden Puppy,"A puppy should remain with his littermates and mother until heâs eight weeks old.

Assuming you have an eight-week-old puppy, he should receive three to four meals a day. So youâll split the amounts suggested into each daily feeding at the same scheduled intervals every day.

Feeding at the same times every day will help the puppyâs ability to digest his food and for him to have a source of energy throughout the day.

From eight weeks old until about five or six months old, three meals per day are advisable. Of course, feed at the same intervals every day and split the total amount per day in half to be given at each feeding.

After about six months of age through adulthood, two feedings per day are the norm.

Always check with your vet regarding how much and how often to feed. These are just guidelines.

Feed him at the same distraction-free location so that he focuses on eating. As much as goldens love to eat, a young golden puppy is also very easily distracted.

Give him about 15 or 20 minutes to eat, then pick up any food thatâs left. Most puppies will learn to eat while the foodâs down.

If he misses a couple of meals and has no interest in the food, consult with your vet to determine whether anythingâs wrong.

Donât free-feed your golden retriever puppy.Â If you leave the food down all the time, heâll probably overeat and become overweight.Â

This can lead to possible health problems, including joint and bone problems. Goldens can easily become overweight.

Also, if you always leave his food in his bowl on the floor, you wonât be able to properly house train him because you wonât be able to anticipate when he has to defecate.

Free feeding can also lead to a picky eater. Some puppies figure out that if their buffets are always there, and they can just go graze at will.",Other Feeding Options,"Although I concentrated in this article on feeding kibble to your new puppy, there are other options.

There are some drawbacks to them because they may not be nutritionally complete, may be cost prohibitive, or may be too time-consuming to make.

Wet Food

Canned food alone or mixed with kibble is an option. But wet food alone is very expensive.

If you plan to change over to kibble at some point, your puppy may not eat it because itâs not as enticing. He may become a picky eater.

Also, youâd have to give a lot of wet food to be sure that he has the proper nutrients. And heâll have to potty more often because of the bulk amount of moisture in the food.

Raw/BARF Diet

BARF stands for biologically appropriate raw food or bones and raw food. Feeding raw is controversial.

Some vets say it doesnât provide proper nutrients and that bacteria in the raw bones or meat can pose a health hazard to dogs and their humans.

The bones can also pose a choking hazard, can break teeth, or can puncture a dogâs intestines.

Dehydrated raw foods reduce some of the risks.

However, all experts agree that puppies should not be fed a raw/barf diet.

The ratio of calcium to phosphorous is crucial to puppy development. Itâs almost impossible to get that ratio exactly right with a raw diet.

Homemade Diet

Cooking for your best friend can be very appealing. And many people do.

You know what ingredients and their quality are.

But it has its drawbacks. Itâs hard to know whether the food you make is nutritionally complete.

Of course, you can use a recipe thatâs been created or approved by a veterinary nutritionist. And you can add supplements that expert approves to add to your pupâs diet.

Another drawback is that itâs very time-consuming to create a diet for a large-breed puppy.

Iâve always fed a nutritionally complete commercial kibble to my dogs. And theyâve been healthy on it.

Of course, Iâve extensively researched the foods theyâve eaten."
how much is a golden retriever puppy,Cost of Adopting a Golden Retriever,"Buying a golden retriever versus adopting one is a common debate for aspiring dog owners. Adopting a dog usually means finding your future pet at a rescue or shelter. Conversely, when you choose to buy a golden retriever you typically purchase the dog directly from their owner or breeder.

Adoption is typically cheaper than buying a golden retriever since starting adoption fees tend to be around $250 to $500. Please note that depending on the shelter, you may have to pay additional golden retriever costs for certain shots and procedures.

Unfortunately, at shelters and rescues, you may not have a wide selection of dogs to choose from — especially if you’re looking for a specific gender, breed, age, or health level.

It’s also important to remember that, sometimes, adopted golden retrievers have behavior or health issues, which could make things harder for you in the future. You simply don’t know as much about your new dog’s history as you would if you purchased directly from a trusted breeder.

On the other hand, when you buy from a reputable breeder, you’ll have a higher chance of bringing home a happy and healthy golden retriever that will cost you less in the long run.",Buying a Golden Retriever Puppy from Us,"At My Golden Retriever Puppies, all of our dogs come with a 2-year genetic health guarantee, a certified vet check, dewormings, and AKC paperwork.

If you think you’ll need them, go ahead and budget for them and add the costs to the total figures.

Dog Walking

Golden Retrievers are active and sporting dogs, so they need to be exercised for at least an hour every day. Not all families can commit to this every day. Either through work commitments or because of an unexpected injury yourself. This means you’ll need to hire a dog walker to keep your Golden exercised and healthy.

Dog walkers will charge, on average, $20 for a group walk lasting 30 minutes. Longer or one-to-one walks cost more. Some owners find that they (and their pups) are better off going to doggy daycare instead. This will typically cost around $25, and it can be a great way to keep your dog healthy and socialized.

Grooming

The best asset of a Golden Retriever’s appearance is its golden coat, and it can take a fair bit of work to keep it looking pretty. For this reason, some owners prefer to send their pooch to a professional groomer every few months. This is more likely to be a must rather than a want if you have a show dog.

Grooming costs depend on the groomer’s experience, the dog breed, the level of service you need, and your pup’s behavior. If your dog doesn’t enjoy grooming, it will cost more because it takes longer, and there is more risk for the groomer. Typically, the cost of grooming a Golden (including bathing, trimming, nail clipping, etc.) will cost around $70.

Traveling

Whether you love to travel doggy-free or need emergency boarding for a last-minute work trip or a family emergency, your pooch may require boarding. The average dog boarding facility costs between $25 and $85 per night, depending on the kennels’ amenities, the size of your dog, and the current demand. The cost of boarding a Golden is likely to fall somewhere in the middle at $55.",Breeder Quality,"Breeder quality is one of the most significant influences on puppy price. A responsible breeder will screen their dogs for health problems and only breed the healthiest. This means that they are more likely to breed healthy litters. This incurs extra costs for them which need to be covered by you. But it is definitely worth the additional expense as it means a happy and healthy pup.

If you choose to spend less on your pup by working with a poor-quality breeder, sure, you’ll save a few hundred dollars. But this could equate to thousands of dollars in the future on both vet and training bills. Not only are irresponsible breeders more likely to breed unhealthy pups, but they are also more likely to create unsocialized and behavior-challenged puppies. It is not worth the risk!"
how much are rottweiler puppies,Do Rottweilers shed?,"The Rottweiler sheds moderately throughout the year. Spring and autumn are exceptions, as copious amounts of shedding are to be expected around these seasons. Thus, the Rottie is a non-hypoallergenic breed and therefore not the best choice for dog lovers with allergies. When it comes to grooming, the Rottweiler has a relatively easy-to-maintain coat that requires weekly brushing using a soft bristle brush or a rubber hound mitt. During shedding season, brushing should be done more frequently to get rid of loose and dead hair effectively. Bathing should only be done when it is required to prevent his skin and coat from drying out. Wiping him down with a damp towel once a while will also help keep his coat clean. Do not forget to regularly check his skin for ticks, fleas, injuries, or skin infections that need medical attention.",Are Rottweilers dangerous?,"Rottweilers are calm, confident, and good-natured. He’s not vicious nor aggressive but possesses guarding instincts. This explains the dog’s protective instincts to keep his home and family safe.

Rotties should be kept indoors, which is contrary to the belief that he is fine living outside in kennels. That’s because he is very sociable and deeply family-oriented. Thus, he cannot stand the lack of human interaction, which can lead him to develop separation anxiety and a slew of destructive habits.

With a wait-and-see attitude towards different situations in the environment, the Rottweiler remains calm and responds quietly. He can be aloof towards strangers, and it takes time before he warms up to any guests coming to your home.

Rottweilers are intelligent, adaptable, and hardworking. Male Rottweilers are quieter and more vigilant, whilst female Rotties are more manageable and warm. The breed thrives as guarding and police dogs.",Are Rottweilers smart?,"The Rottie is one of the smartest dog breeds in the world. However, realistically, training a Rottweiler can be quite challenging as he has a protective and domineering nature.

Rottweiler training requires a lot of time, patience, and assertiveness from the handler. When leadership is established, training will be much easier.

Positive reinforcement is also necessary to keep your Rottie focused and motivated to cooperate during training sessions. Whilst you can give lots of praises every time he successfully carries out commands, moderation should be done when rewarding him with treats as the breed is prone to obesity.

Avoid incorporating punishments and harsh training methods as these are counterproductive. It will not only lead the Rottie to lose interest in learning but will also damage your bond with him. If you feel frustrated with him, it is best to walk away and try again later.",Calculating The Cost For A Rottweiler Puppy,"One thing you will probably notice right away is that different breeders charge different prices for Rottweiler puppies. Some breeders will even change their prices from one litter of puppies to the next.

Why does the cost for a Rottweiler puppy vary so much? How can you know you are getting a fair price for a healthy puppy?

This is a more complicated topic than it seems on the surface. There are several different levels of dog breeders and prices often vary accordingly.

For general discussion purposes at time of publication, the cost for a Rottweiler puppy ranges from $850 to $4,000+.

This cost variance reflects everything from the puppy’s bloodlines and the breeder’s reputation to how expensive that litter was to whelp and raise.",Purebred Rottweiler breeder,"Cost: $$$

Take the case of a reputable, AKC-registered breeder who breeds Rottweilers because they truly love this dog breed. This type of breeder will pre-screen parent dogs for all known genetic health issues before permitting their dogs to breed.

A responsible breeder values their reputation within the dog breeding and show communities and aims to breed healthy, happy, beautiful companion canines, show dogs and/or working K-9 Rottweilers.

But this doesn’t come cheap. This breeder is going to make sure their parent dogs and puppies have the best of everything.

Here are just a few of the major costs a reputable breeder will incur to breed healthy Rottweiler puppies.

• Health testing: $200 per dog

• Stud fee: $500 per attempt

• Whelping and puppy supplies: $200 per litter

• Ultrasound/X-ray: $150 per test

• Special pregnancy/puppy food and supplements: $300 per litter

• C-section delivery (if needed): $1,500

• Puppy vaccines and de-worming: $50 per puppy

• AKC registration: $25 + $2 per puppy

• Tail docking/dewclaw removal: $40 per puppy

• New puppy packets: $200 per litter"
how often do you feed a puppy,Puppy Power,"For young puppies, they actually need a lot of separate meals of smaller amounts to help them grow healthy and strong. Puppies are able to start on solid foods as early as three-to-four weeks old. At that young age, feeding them as many as five times a day may be required. Just keep the amounts relatively small with puppy-specific types of dog food. Check with your veterinarian to determine the appropriate amount of food based on your puppies age and breed.

Once your pup reaches six weeks, you can reduce the amount of meals down to three or four times per day. After eight weeks, three meals a day should be sufficient for your pup, no matter what breed they are. Keep in mind that puppies may start eating less for the period of time when they are teething. This usually occurs for pups between three and six months of age.",Keep It Consistent,"When it comes to feeding your pup, just remember that dogs have sensitive stomachs. Switching pet food brands often may cause them discomfort. If you want to make a switch, be sure to do it gradually over a couple of weeks so they can get used to the different taste and formula.

Overall, the best monitor for your dogâs needs is your dog themselves. If they are perfectly healthy but not eating all of their food, you may be overfeeding them. If they are hungry all the time, they may be missing key nutrients.

Itâs important to be aware of your dogâs eating habits. The amount, speed and how they digest their food will give you a good sense of their health, activity level and general happiness.

However, portion size will vary from dog to dog depending on the dog breed, size, body type, nutritional requirements, individual metabolism, and more. Talking with your vet will give you a good idea about a good portion size to start with for your puppy.

Keeping this in mind, here is an average breakdown of portion size per day by weight of your puppy, which would be spread out throughout their daily feedings:

• 5-pound puppy – ½ to ⅝ cup of food per day

• 10-pound puppy – ¾ to 1 cup of food per day

• 20-pound puppy – 1 ¼ to 1 ¾ cups of food per day

• 40-pound puppy – 2 ¼ to 3 cups of food per day

• 80-pound puppy – 3 ⅔ to 5 cups of food per day

• 100-pound puppy – 4 ¼ to 6 cups of food per day

From there, you want to watch your dog see how they’re filling out.

From there, they can recommend an adjustment to portion size and/or feeding frequency if needed.",After 1 Year,"Once puppies reach one year of age, they are considered an adult dog even if they are a large dog breed that is still growing and developing.

This ensures your puppy gets all the nutrients they need for proper growth and development.",Avoid Raw Diets for Young Puppies,"Although raw diets may be popular for some dog owners, they are not recommended for young puppies younger than 4-6 months. It is difficult to balance a raw diet so that it provides the right nutrients, and enough of them, for a growing pup.

Additionally, young puppies do not have the developed immune system yet to deal with the high bacterial load that is common to raw diets. Because of these reasons, it’s best to stick with high-quality kibble for puppies and the diet your vet recommends for your puppy.

Once they’re over 4 months old, you can gradually introduce some raw meaty bones. However, you will want to consult with your vet before making any switches to a raw diet. They’ll be able to help you determine the right age for your puppy to start making the switch and help you with a plan to make sure they continue getting the nutrients they need throughout the change and after.

These are just a few things to know about how much to feed a puppy, what type of food to feed them, and also how often to feed a puppy. If you have more questions about feeding frequency or portions for your growing puppy or are unsure about the food you’re feeding them, contact your veterinarian and they can help you figure out what’s right for your pup."
how to induce vomiting in a puppy,When to (or Not to) Make a Dog Throw Up,"If a dog eats something harmful that he shouldn’t have, it’s possible he may vomit it up on his own. When that doesn’t happen, making your dog throw up something he’s eaten might seem like a good idea. But the reality is that inducing vomiting is something you should only attempt to do under the guidance of a veterinarian. There are very good reasons for this. Note that if your vet is not open, some services provide live chat and video options to connect you with a vet.

Some substances, such as batteries or other caustic materials or sharp objects, can cause dangerous and even lethal harm if regurgitated. Swallowed objects can cause blockages or perforations, and the act of inducing vomiting itself comes with risks, such as aspiration pneumonia, caused by inhaling toxic substances, usually gastric contents, into the lungs. You may consider soothing your dog’s throat with a pet-safe liquid respiratory supplement after inducing vomiting.

It can be dangerous to induce vomiting in brachycephalic breeds, such as Pugs or Pekingese, because of concerns of causing aspiration pneumonia, so be sure to check with a veterinarian first. Do not induce vomiting if your dog is lethargic or comatose or if he is having seizures. If your dog ingested something more than two-six hours ago, it may be too late to get him to vomit it up, depending on what was ingested.

The safest thing to do is to take your dog into the vet’s office immediately. However, if you can’t get there, you may have to induce vomiting at home. Talk with a veterinarian, or if your dog swallows something dangerous when your vet’s office is closed, call a pet poison control hotline to get advice from the experts before you proceed. When you call, be prepared to provide important information, such as what he ate, how much, and when; your dog’s weight, and any health problems he may have.",Why Hydrogen Peroxide?,"Hydrogen peroxide 3-percent solution is the recommended medication for making a dog throw up. Luckily, it is something many of us have in our medicine cabinet. It’s also a good idea to include a bottle in your dog’s travel first aid kit.

According to PetMD, hydrogen peroxide is a “topical antiseptic that is used orally as a home-administered emetic in dogs when clients cannot transport the patient to a veterinary hospital in a timely manner.” Hydrogen peroxide is an irritant to the dog’s intestinal tract and typically works within 10-15 minutes, recovering about 50 percent of the ingested contents of your dog’s stomach. The vomiting can last for up to 45 minutes, so make sure you dose your dog in a place where he will feel as comfortable as possible throwing up.

Hydrogen peroxide is generally considered safe when administered by a veterinarian. At home, however, you don’t have the luxury of veterinary expertise. Don’t make your dog throw up if he exhibits any of the following symptoms or conditions:

• Already vomiting.

• Severely lethargic.

• Comatose.

• Decreased swallowing ability.

• Difficulty breathing.

• Seizures or hyperactive activity.

• Recent abdominal surgery or megaesophagus (a generalized enlargement of the esophagus).

• Consumed corrosive agents, sharp objects, or drugs.",Steps to Take to Make a Dog Throw Up,"First, always call your veterinarian. Even if you plan on making your dog throw up at home, your veterinarian is a valuable resource and will be able to provide you with the most accurate information about your dog’s condition.

• If your dog hasn’t eaten within the last two hours, giving him a small meal can make it more likely that he will vomit.

• Make sure you have a 3-percent hydrogen peroxide solution. Higher concentrations are toxic and can cause serious damage.

• Administer the proper amount: the suggested dosage is 1 teaspoon per 5 pounds of the dog’s body weight by mouth, with a maximum dose of 3 tablespoons for dogs who weigh more than 45 pounds. But ask your veterinarian about the best dosage for your dog and only induce vomiting if your dog ate the substance within 2 hours.

•  Administer the dosage with a feeding syringe or turkey baster and squirt it from the side by pulling back his lips and squirting between his back teeth. You can also squirt from the front into the back of your dog’s tongue or mouth. Be careful not to let your dog inhale the substance, as this can lead to aspiration. If your dog doesn’t vomit within 15 minutes, you can give him a second dose.

• Stay with your dog while he vomits. Collect the vomit for your vet to analyze, and do not let your dog re-ingest the material.

• Keep an eye out for complications and adverse reactions, such as vomiting for more than 45 minutes, diarrhea, lethargy, bloat or gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), or gastric ulcers.

• Follow up with your veterinarian as soon as possible.

Timing is critical, and the safest step is to take your dog to the veterinary office or emergency clinic to have vomiting induced. In some cases, other treatment may also be needed, such as IV fluids. And if you haven’t been successful making your dog vomit, your vet may give him a stronger medication to get rid of the substance he swallowed, as well as the hydrogen peroxide.",Speak to Your Veterinarian Immediately,"4. Be sure to call your veterinarian or the nearest open emergency clinic immediately if your dog digests something they shouldn’t. Depending on the seriousness of the incident, you can also contact a 24/7 Pet Helpline. If vomiting is required, your veterinarian will give your dog special medication (typically Apomorphine) in the hospital to help induce vomiting. These medications are typically safer than hydrogen peroxide. Remember it is much safer and more effective to have your dog induced at a veterinary hospital. Additionally, most toxicities need additional treatment such as IV fluids and activated charcoal for best results.

Before you do anything, read the steps below and, of course, always speak with a vet as soon as you can. Vet’s know more accurate information regarding the best (and safest) way to induce vomiting in dogs.

1. If your dog ate something bad in the last 2 hours: get 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Don’t get anything higher than that because the higher concentrations can be very dangerous for your dog.

2. Contact your veterinarian, see what dosage they think is best for your dog. If a vet is unavailable, reach out to the veterinarians at Airvet. It’s a good rule of thumb to do 1 teaspoon per 5 pounds taken in the mouth. It’s important to know that you should never give your dog over 3 tablespoons of the solution.

3. Give your dog the hydrogen peroxide. To make sure they swallow the solution, get a turkey baster and inject it into your dog’s mouth by squirting it between their back teeth. You will most likely need to pull up their lip so you can get in there. If this isn’t working, you can administer the solution from the front of their mouth, but make sure they don’t inhale it.

4. If your dog doesn’t start vomiting in around 15 minutes, try another dose. That might be the push they need.

5. Once they have vomited, keep an eye out for any adverse reactions like lethargy, diarrhea, or if they vomit for more than 45 minutes.

If your dog isn’t experiencing any adverse reactions, call your veterinarian, and bring them in for an in-person visit ASAP. Your vet may want to give them something else to completely rid them of what your dog ingested. Plus, a good check-up with a licensed professional is always the best scenario for peace of mind."
how to leash train a puppy,Why is dog leash training important?,"As mentioned, training your dog to walk on a leash is really important. So let’s take a moment here to appreciate just how very essential it is. Here are several reasons why leash training a puppy or dog is crucial for every dog parent:

• If your dog pulls on the leash, you’ll probably get frustrated. This frustration may cause you to lose your temper, or resent having to walk the dog in the first place. You might even use punishment. And all these things have a negative impact on your relationship with your furry friend.• Your dog will get frustrated too if they always feel like they “have to” strain against their leash. This could lead to your dog behaving aggressively, or simply getting stressed out. In this state, your dog is more likely to threaten other dogs1.• Pulling on your dog’s leash constantly can have negative consequences for their health. It could cause injury to their neck, and put stress on their joints.• The tension in a leash (loose vs tight) is important because it helps communicate with your dog. If the leash suddenly goes taut, it may mean your dog is frightened, or ready to fight. Similarly, how you hold the leash will communicate to your dog how you are feeling.• Finally, dog leash training is important because we love our dogs and don’t want them to come into harm’s way. (Discover how Tractive GPS helps.)

Luckily, training a dog to walk on a leash can be easier than you think.",When is it necessary to use a leash?,"As a dog parent, it’s your responsibility to inform yourself of and follow any laws in your local area related to dogs. For example, the paragraph below explains some of the regulations regarding dogs in Franklin County, Ohio.  Visit your local government’s website to find the local dog laws in your area. And of course, be sure to abide by the relevant dog laws when you are traveling with your dog.

In addition to obeying dog leash laws, it’s a good idea to use a dog leash:

• when your dog has not yet been trained • during spring and wildlife breeding season• if your dog shows aggression or has other behavioral issues• in crowded or high-traffic areas• any time you’re worried about your dog running away

In addition to a leash, a Tractive GPS dog tracker can be you and your dog’s best friend. With it, you can track your dog anytime, in real time, no matter how far away they wander.

Discover Tractive GPS",Final tips on leash training a puppy or dog,"Remember, leash training a puppy or dog takes time, patience and plenty of positive reinforcement. So whatever you do, try to stay calm and be patient with your dog. With the tips below and a consistent effort, together you will master the art of walking on the leash in no time.

• Leash training is an essential part of every dog-human bond• You can start leash training your puppy as early as 4 weeks old• First, get your dog used to the collar or harness and leash • Start training indoors before you take things outdoors• Let your dog come to you, then reward them with treats for good behavior• Never pull on the leash• Use a GPS dog tracker for extra security and peace of mind• Be patient, positive and kind to your dog throughout the leash training process",How to leash train a puppy?,"And it can be a difficult skill for them to learn. Humans and dogs move at different paces, move in different ways, have different priorities and experience the environment very differently. So attaching one to another creates potential conflict right away. Our motivation and goals are often very different, or even in conflict with one another.

And it’s a difficult skill for the human end of the lead to master too. Good lead handling and body movement is a skill that takes practice and for new puppy owners managing the lead AND the dog AND a clicker AND food can seem overwhelming.

When we teach loose lead walking what are we actually teaching our dogs to do? Not pull on the lead? Or to move with us regardless of the lead? If we focus only on what we DON’T want we aren’t really teaching what we DO want.

What we really want is a dog who can move comfortably with us through the environment regardless of whether they’re attached to us by a lead or not. Your lead is a safety belt, not a steering wheel.",A Word About Equipment,"I’m often asked what equipment can help stop pulling and encourage loose lead walking but it’s not equipment which makes for connected, co-operative lead walking, it’s training. I recommend either a standard flat collar or a non-tightening harness like Perfect Fit or similar. A longer lead allows for more movement without pulling so use the longest lead you safely can for the environment you are working in; I most often use a 6ft or 8ft lead.

Loose lead walking takes time, patience and commitment but your effort will be repaid a hundredfold when you enjoy relaxed, calm and connected walks together for years to come.

Does your dog growl, bark, lunge or show fear when seeing other dogs and people on walks and at home? Do you struggle to keep your dog calm and relaxed when out and about?

how to socialize a puppy,When to Socialize Your Puppy,"During your puppy’s first three months of life, he will experience a socialization period that will permanently shape his future personality and how he will react to his environment as an adult dog. Gently exposing him to a wide variety of people, places, and situations now makes a huge, permanent difference in his temperament.

When you buy a puppy from a responsible breeder, the socialization process should start before you even bring your puppy home. Gentle handling by the breeder in the first several weeks of your puppy’s life is helpful in the development of a friendly, confident dog. As early as 3 weeks of age, puppies may begin to approach a person who is passively observing them, so having a knowledgeable breeder who encourages a positive experience with people – adults and children — will help shape the puppy’s adult behavior. As their puppies develop, good breeders allow them to experience safe inside and outside environments, car rides, crates, sounds, smells, and gentle handling.",Why Socialize Your Puppy,"The idea behind socialization is that you want to help your puppy become acclimated to all types of sights, sounds, and smells in a positive manner. Proper socialization can prevent a dog from being fearful of children, for example, or of riding in a car, and it will help him develop into a well-mannered, happy companion.

Having a dog who is well adjusted and confident can even go as far as to save his life one day. According to the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior, improper socialization can lead to behavior problems later in life. The organization’s position statement on socialization reads: “Behavioral issues, not infectious diseases, are the number one cause of death for dogs under three years of age.” Start taking your dog out to public places once your veterinarian says it is safe, and he’ll learn to behave in a variety of situations and to enjoy interacting with different people.",What About Older Dogs?,"All of this information on how important socialization is for puppies brings up the question “what about older dogs?” If you’ve acquired a dog who is no longer a puppy, you can still help him associate new or fearful situations with a positive experience, even though you’ve missed the crucial puppy socialization period. Slowly reintroducing the dog to new sights, smells, and sounds, with careful supervision and an emphasis on positivity in the form of praise and treats can help him overcome his fears or hesitation. (Severe cases of fearfulness should be treated with the help of a veterinarian and/or animal behaviorist.)

The AKC Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test is an excellent goal for owners of dogs who received little training in their past (or even for S.T.A.R. puppies who are ready to take their skills to the next level). This 10-step test demonstrates that a dog can show good manners and basic obedience skills. You can then go on to lead your dog through the advanced CGC test, called AKC Community Canine (CGCA), and/or the AKC Urban CGC (CGCU).",PUPPY SOCIALIZATION: OVERVIEW,"1. Make a commitment to super-socialize your puppy, and then do it — early. Don’t procrastinate; you don’t have much time!

2. Stay aware of your pup’s body language and help him out of trouble if he looks stressed. Be prepared to take prompt remedial action it your pup has a negative experience during your socialization program.

3. Sign up as soon as possible for a well-run positive puppy class, where both of you can socialize and have a good time.

When it comes to puppies who don’t get lots of opportunities to interact positively with other dogs, new people, or novel situations, the end results are often messy.

While curiosity and the ability to learn don’t have expiration dates, young puppies have an important behavioral “sweet spot” between the ages of 13 and 14 weeks. During this critical period, your dog builds her impressions and attitudes about what is normal and acceptable. At this time more than any other, positive experiences with the world around her build a solid foundation for the rest of your dog’s life.

As recently as 30 years ago, trainers and owners didn’t talk much about puppy socialization. But today, most people know about the importance of making puppies well-rounded little Renaissance hounds. And as they have gotten busy signing up for puppy kindergarten and arranging play dates with the dog next door, a new concern has developed: Fueled more by enthusiasm than knowledge, some people expose puppies to the world in a way that emphasizes its dangers rather than its delights.

Like anything in life, it’s all about balance. Here are some tips to help you guide your puppy through this brave new world in a way that will broaden her horizons and build her confidence.",Keep Your Puppy’s Experiences Positive,"Socialization isn’t just about exposing your puppy to new things. It’s also about carefully monitoring these interactions to ensure they are positive ones. Though puppies can seem precociously unflappable – especially when they are gnawing your ankles – they are sensitive souls who can easily become overwhelmed. Your job is to gauge the tenor of a situation by reading your puppy’s body language.

“If your puppy clings to you, if she’s yawning or turning her head away, she’s stressed. Forcing the puppy will just make it worse,” says trainer and author Teoti Anderson of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “Puppy emotions can be so fleeting. If more puppy owners paid attention to that, and just let the puppy go at his own pace, they’d avoid a lot of problems.”

In the buffet of sensory stimulation that your puppy encounters, make sure his experience is a quick snack rather than a binge. A visit to your child’s soccer game, for instance, can do more harm than good if you are distracted, a pack of kids swarms the cute new puppy, and someone’s snarky Schnoodle meanders over to chomp instead of chat. Less really can be more.

“I like lots of frequent, short sessions. Some puppies shouldn’t go out every day, especially if you have a puppy that’s a little shy,” Anderson says. “Instead, find five friends of different ages and ethnicities and have them over for 10 minutes.” Your puppy will be exposed to a variety of new, interesting people, “and you’ve ended it before it can go badly.”

Be sure to monitor the humans in this equation, too, especially if they are not very dog savvy: Something as simple as holding a puppy incorrectly – letting his legs dangle without supporting his bottom, for instance – can make him feel unstable and unsafe."
how often should i feed my puppy,Puppy Feeding Schedule,"How often do you have to feed your puppy for him to receive the right quantity and quality of food? To sustain his growth spurt and replenish his energy depletion, a puppy eats a lot of food. You must first ask your veterinarian the daily feeding amount your puppy specifically needs. After this, divide the said quantity into smaller portions to be equally distributed throughout the day at regular intervals.As their body clock also tells dogs when it is time for a routine task, consistent feeding times promote a structure to help your new puppy adjust to his home and daily life.You must plan out a puppy feeding schedule to efficiently provide those small frequent feedings to him at the same time every day. This can help you monitor how much he is eating which is an important way to maintain his ideal weight.Having a dog feeding tracker would surely help you maintain your schedule of feeding your furry companions.",How Many Times Per Day Do You Feed A Puppy?,"Generally, it depends on how old your puppy is. You do not have to worry because we got you covered. Below is a simple need-to-know guide for you in making your own puppy feeding schedule. We have already incorporated his daily activities and other essential details that you should take into account.

Zero – Six Months (0-24 weeks)

Normally, it takes puppies around six to eight weeks from birth before they can be completely weaned. After this, you should feed your puppy three to four times a day to support his growth and development. Experts say that a good rule to follow is that at one week old, when the puppy’s weight is twice as heavy as when he was born, he should gain one to two grams per pound each day thereafter of his breed’s estimated adult weight.But, how long do you need to feed a puppy 3 times a day? Pet experts recommend that you follow a standard feeding schedule similar to this until your puppy is about 16 – 24 weeks (four-six months) old and then gradually transition to feeding him two meals a day toward adulthood.

Six Months – One Year

At about six months old, you should reduce your puppy’s meal times to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, until he becomes a mature adult dog. You should also slowly lessen the amount of food he eats, following the guidelines provided by dog food manufacturers or your vet, and adjusting as needed. Your puppy will let you know if you are feeding him too much by having leftovers in his bowl.

One Year And Beyond

When your puppy already becomes an adult dog, you can now feed him just once or twice a day. Usually, most puppies reach adulthood at around one year old. However, for large breed puppies, it may take up to two years before they mature. The dog food packaging should have feeding instructions on the label. But if you are uncertain when to transition to an adult dog food, you can always ask your vet.",Special Considerations,"• To prevent stomach upset or choking accidents for a puppy who gobbles up all his food with minimal chewing, slow him down by adjusting how you feed him or try a slow feeder or food-dispensing toy.• Do not be tempted to feed him whenever he seems hungry nor leave food in his bowl all the time so that he can learn to follow the schedule.• Have fresh water available at all times. Keeping our pups hydrated is important too!• You have to factor in potty training into your puppy feeding schedule. They go hand in hand as part of puppy training and can give you a better sense of when your puppy will have to go to the potty.• To avoid mishaps indoors, feed him early at night so his meal can be digested before he sleeps.• If you cannot be there with him during these feeding times, ask another family member. Or, you may also want to consider getting a dog sitter to help.• Visit your veterinarian if you are unsure about what and when to feed your puppy as some dog breeds may require a special diet.",How Often Should You Feed Your Puppy?,"From as soon as you get the puppy home from the breeder, you should feed them four times per day until they are four months old (16 weeks of age).

At four months old, you can drop your feeding schedule down to three meals a day and stick at this until the puppy reaches six months old (24 weeks of age).

Once they reach that age, they can be fed twice a day. You can then stick to this schedule of feeding them twice a day forever.

But remember, like humans, they might have times when they want a little more, especially at bedtime, so expect them to say so loudly.

That is basically it. In a nutshell, you now have a really easy-to-follow puppy feeding schedule that will allow them to eat well as they grow up into eating a diet of adult dog food.

(These feeding schedules are the same for small and large breed dogs, the difference is in the amount of food they are given, not the frequency).

NOTE – We are confident our puppy feeding advice will be fine for your young dog, but we suggest you always double-check the feeding schedule when you talk to your veterinarian to ensure good health.",What About Snacks in Between Meals?,"Small health snacks in between meals are not only ok for puppies but advisable.

Puppies only have tiny little bellies, so the food goes through them much quicker than it would an adult dog.

So giving them some little snacks of food throughout the day will help keep up their energy levels with some nice healthy puppy nutrition.

Snacks such as kibble or treats tend to be dry, as opposed to the canned food, so it is even more important to make sure the dog is drinking enough water to compensate for the courser ingredients.

What Sort of Snacks Should You Give Them?

When your puppy is really young, you should only give them soft, easy to chew food for snacks, and it should be in bite-sized pieces to reduce the risk of choking.

There are many purpose-made snacks ideal for busy pet puppy owners, which are great for feeding your puppy as a nice little treat.

Or you can make your own healthy puppy food treats for your pup.

For example (you might be surprised at this), lots of puppies will really enjoy eating raw or cooked vegetables.

Or you can give them snacks for raw or cooked meat if you prefer.

Please make sure the snacks are appropriate for their age, easy to chew and swallow, and use foods that the dog gets excited about so that they are an effective reward for good behavior during training.

NOTE – We still encourage you to give adult dogs snacks, but perhaps less than you would for puppies.

We would just use them for an occasional treat for older dogs and also for rewarding them for good behavior."
